In a tight <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/20\/heres-everything-apple-announced-at-its-spring-loaded-event-today\/\">single hour this week<\/a>, Apple launched a ton of new product including AirTags, new Apple Card family sharing, a new Apple TV, a new set of colorful iMacs, and a purple iPhone 12 shade.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Of the new devices announced, though, Apple\u2019s new 12.9\u201d iPad Pro is the most interesting from a market positioning perspective.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This week I got a chance to speak to Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Greg Joswiak and Senior Vice President of Hardware Engineering John Ternus about this latest version of the iPad Pro and its place in the working universe of computing professionals.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">In many ways, this new iPad Pro is the equivalent of a sprinter being lengths ahead going into the last lap and just turning on the afterburners to put a undebatable distance between themselves and the rest of the pack. Last year\u2019s model is still one of the best computers you can buy, with a densely packed offering of powerful computing tools, battery performance and portability. And this year gets upgrades in the M1 processor, RAM, storage speed, Thunderbolt connection, 5G radio, new ultra wide front camera and its Liquid Retina XDR display.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This is a major bump even while the 2020 iPad Pro still dominates the field. And at the center of that is the display.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Apple has essentially ported its enormously good $5,000 Pro Display XDR down to a 12.9\u201d touch version, with some slight improvements. But the specs are flat out incredible. 1,000 nit brightness peaking at 1,600 nits in HDR with 2,500 full array local dimming zones \u2014 compared to the Pro Display XDR\u2019s 576 in a much larger scale.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Given that this year\u2019s first product launch from Apple was virtual, the media again got no immediate hands on with the new devices introduced, including iPad Pro. This means that I have not yet seen the XDR display in action. Unfortunately, these specs are so good that estimating them without having seen the screen yet is akin to trying to visualize \u201ca trillion\u201d in your head. It\u2019s intellectually possible but not really practical.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s brighter than any Mac or iOS device on the market and could be a big game shifting device for professionals working in HDR video and photography. But even still, this is a major investment to ship a micro-LED display in the millions or tens of millions of units with more density and brightness than any other display on the market.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I ask both of them why there\u2019s a need to do this doubling down on what is already one of the best portable displays ever made \u2014 if not one of the best displays period.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.02-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2143477\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.02-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.02-1.jpg 3600w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.02-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.02-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.02-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.02-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.02-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.02-1.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.02-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWe&#8217;ve always tried to have the best display,\u201d says Ternus. \u201cWe&#8217;re going from the best display on any device like this and making it even better, because that&#8217;s what we do and that&#8217;s why we, we love coming to work every day is to take that next big step.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201c[With the] Pro Display XDR if you remember one thing we talked about was being able to have this display and this capability in more places in the work stream. Because traditionally there was just this one super expensive reference monitor at the end of the line. This is like the next extreme of that now you don&#8217;t even have to be in the studio anymore you can take it with you on the go and you can have that capability so from a, from a creative pro standpoint we think this is going to be huge.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In my use of the Pro Display and my conversations with professionals about it one of the the common themes that I\u2019ve heard is the reduction in overall workload due to the multiple points in the flow where color and image can be managed accurately to spec now. The general system in place puts a reference monitor very late in the production stage which can often lead to expensive and time consuming re-rendering or new color passes. Adding the Liquid Retina XDR display into the mix at an extremely low price point means that a lot more plot points on the production line suddenly get a lot closer to the right curve.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">One of the stronger answers on the \u2018why the aggressive spec bump\u2019 question comes later in our discussion but is worth mentioning in this context. The point, Joswiak says, is to offer headroom. Headroom for users and headroom for developers.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cOne of the things that iPad Pro has done as John [Ternus] has talked about is push the envelope. And by pushing the envelope that has created this space for developers to come in and fill it. When we created the very first iPad Pro, there was no Photoshop,\u201d Joswiak notes. \u201cThere was no creative apps that could immediately use it. But now there&#8217;s so many you can&#8217;t count. Because we created that capability, we created that performance \u2014 and, by the way sold a fairly massive number of them \u2014 which is a pretty good combination for developers to then come in and say, I can take advantage of that. There&#8217;s enough customers here and there&#8217;s enough performance. I know how to use that. And that&#8217;s the same thing we do with each generation. We create more headroom to performance that developers will figure out how to use.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThe customer is in a great spot because they know they&#8217;re buying something that&#8217;s got some headroom and developers love it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.John_Ternus.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2143480\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.John_Ternus.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.John_Ternus.jpg 3600w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.John_Ternus.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.John_Ternus.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.John_Ternus.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.John_Ternus.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.John_Ternus.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.John_Ternus.jpg?resize=2048,1151 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.John_Ternus.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The iPad Pro is now powered by the M1 chip \u2014 a move away from the A-series naming. And that processor part is identical (given similar memory configurations) to the one found in the iMac announced this week and MacBooks launched earlier this year.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIt&#8217;s the same part, it&#8217;s M1,\u201d says Ternus. \u201ciPad Pro has always had the best Apple silicon we make.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cHow crazy is it that you can take a chip that&#8217;s in a desktop, and drop it into an iPad,\u201d says Joswiak. \u201cI mean it&#8217;s just incredible to have that kind of performance at such amazing power efficiency. And then have all the technologies that come with it. To have the neural engine and ISP and Thunderbolt and all these amazing things that come with it, it&#8217;s just miles beyond what anybody else is doing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As the M1 was rolling out and I <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/17\/yeah-apples-m1-macbook-pro-is-powerful-but-its-the-battery-life-that-will-blow-you-away\/\">began running my testing<\/a>, the power per watt aspects really became the story. That really is the big differentiator for M1. For decades, laptop users have been accustomed to saving any heavy or intense workloads for the times when their machines were plugged in due to power consumption. M1 is in the process of resetting those expectations for desktop class processors. In fact, Apple is offering not only the most powerful CPUs but also the most power-efficient CPUs on the market. And it\u2019s doing it in a $700 Mac Mini, a $1,700 iMac and a $1,100 iPad Pro <a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremetech.com\/computing\/322120-apples-m1-positioning-mocks-every-x86-cpu-amd-and-intel-have-ever-launched\">at the same time<\/a>. It\u2019s a pretty ridiculous display of stunting, but it\u2019s also the product of more than a decade of work building its own architecture and silicon.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYour battery life is defined by the capacity of your battery and the efficiency of your system right? So we&#8217;re always pushing really really hard on the system efficiency and obviously with M1, the team&#8217;s done a tremendous job with that. But the display as well. We designed a new mini LED for this display, focusing on efficiency and on package size, obviously, to really to be able to make sure that it could fit into the iPad experience with the iPad experience\u2019s good battery life.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;We weren&#8217;t going to compromise on that,\u201d says Ternus.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">One of the marquee features of the new iPad Pro is its 12MP ultra-wide camera with Center Stage. An auto-centering and cropping video feature designed to make FaceTime calling more human-centric, literally. It finds humans in the frame and centers their faces, keeping them in the frame even if they move, standing and stretching or leaning to the side. It also includes additional people in the frame automatically if they enter the range of the new ultra-wide 12MP front-facing camera. And yes, it also works with other apps like Zoom and Webex and there will be an API for it.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I\u2019ve gotten to see it in action a bit more and I can say with surety that this will become an industry standard implementation of this kind of subject focusing. The crop mechanic is handled with taste, taking on the characteristics of a smooth zoom pulled by a steady hand rather than an abrupt cut to a smaller, closer framing. It really is like watching a TV show directed by an invisible machine learning engine.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThis is one of the examples of some of our favorite stuff to do because of the way it marries the hardware and software right,\u201d Ternus says. \u201cSo, sure it&#8217;s the camera but it&#8217;s also the SOC and and the algorithms associated with detecting the person and panning and zooming. There&#8217;s the kind of the taste aspect, right? Which is; how do we make something that feels good it doesn&#8217;t move too fast and doesn&#8217;t move too slow. That\u2019s a lot of talented, creative people coming together and trying to find the thing that makes it Apple like.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2143483\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg 3600w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It also goes a long way to masking the awkward horizontal camera placement when using the iPad Pro with Magic Keyboard. This has been a big drawback for using the iPad Pro as a portable video conferencing tool, something we\u2019ve all been doing a lot of lately. I ask Ternus whether Center Stage was designed to mitigate this placement.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWell, you can use iPad in any orientation right? So you&#8217;re going to have different experiences based on how you&#8217;re using it. But what&#8217;s amazing about this is that we can keep correcting the frame. What&#8217;s been really cool is that we&#8217;ve all been sitting around in these meetings all day long on video conferencing and it&#8217;s just nice to get up. This experience of just being able to stand up and kind of stretch and move around the room without walking away from the camera has been just absolutely game changing, it&#8217;s really cool.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s worth noting that several other video sharing devices like the Portal and some video software like Teams already offer cropping-type follow features, but the user experience is everything when you\u2019re shipping software like this to millions of people at once. It will be interesting to see how Center Stage stacks up agains the competition when we see it live.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">With the ongoing chatter about how the iPad Pro and Mac are converging from a feature-set perspective, I ask how they would you characterize an iPad Pro vs. a MacBook buyer? Joswiak is quick to respond to this one.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThis is my favorite question because you know, you have one camp of people who believe that the iPad and the Mac are at war with one another right it&#8217;s one or the other to the death. And then you have others who are like, no, they&#8217;re bringing them together \u2014 they&#8217;re forcing them into one single platform and there&#8217;s a grand conspiracy here,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThey are at opposite ends of a thought spectrum and the reality is that neither is correct. We pride ourselves in the fact that we work really, really, really hard to have the best products in the respective categories. The Mac is the best personal computer, it just is. Customer satisfaction would indicate that is the case, by a longshot.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Joswiak points out that the whole PC category is growing, which he says is nice to see. But he points out that Macs are way outgrowing PCs and doing \u2018quite well\u2019. He also notes that the iPad business is still outgrowing the tablets category (while still refusing to label the iPad a tablet).<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cAnd it\u2019s also the case that it&#8217;s not an \u2018either or\u2019. The majority of our Mac customers have an iPad. That&#8217;s an awesome thing. They don&#8217;t have it because they&#8217;re replacing their Mac, it&#8217;s because they use the right tool at the right time.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">What&#8217;s very cool about what [Ternus] and his team have done with iPad Pro is that they&#8217;ve created something where that&#8217;s still the case for creative professionals too \u2014 the hardest to please audience. They\u2019ve given them a tool where they can be equally at home using the Mac for their professional making money with it kind of work, and now they can pick up an iPad Pro \u2014 and they have been for multiple generations now and do things that, again, are part of how they make money, part of their creative workflow flow,\u201d says Joswiak. \u201cAnd that test is exciting. it isn&#8217;t one or the other, both of them have a role for these people.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Since converting over to an iPad Pro <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/24\/review-100000-miles-and-one-week-with-an-ipad-pro\/\">as my only portable computer<\/a>, I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about the multimodal aspects of professional work. And, clearly, Apple has as well given its launch <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/05\/apples-2019-imac-pro-will-be-shaped-by-workflows\/\">of a Pro Workflows team<\/a> back in 2018. Workflows have changed massively over the last decade, and obviously the iPhone and an iPad, with their popularization of the direct manipulation paradigm, have had everything to do with that. In the current world we\u2019re in, we\u2019re way past \u2018what is this new thing\u2019, and we&#8217;re even way past \u2018oh cool, this feels normal\u2019 and we\u2019re well into \u2018this feels vital, it feels necessary.\u2019<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;Contrary to some people&#8217;s beliefs, we&#8217;re never thinking about what we should not do on an iPad because we don&#8217;t want to encroach on Mac or vice versa,\u201d says Ternus. \u201cOur focus is, what is the best way? What is the best iPad we can make what are the best Macs we can make. Some people are going to work across both of them, some people will kind of lean towards one because it better suits their needs and that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s all good.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you follow along, you\u2019ll know that Apple studiously refuses to enter into the iPad vs. Mac debate \u2014 and in fact likes to place the iPad in a special place in the market that exists unchallenged. Joswiak often says that he doesn\u2019t even like to say the word tablet.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThere\u2019s iPads and tablets, and tablets aren\u2019t very good. iPads are great,\u201d Joswiak says. \u201cWe&#8217;re always pushing the boundaries with iPad Pro, and that&#8217;s what you want leaders to do. Leaders are the ones that push the boundaries leaders are the ones that take this further than has ever been taken before and the XDR display is a great example of that. Who else would you expect to do that other than us. And then once you see it, and once you use it, you won&#8217;t wonder, you\u2019ll be glad we did.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Image Credits: Apple<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When the third minute of Apple\u2019s first product event of 2021 ticked over and they had already made 3 announcements we knew it was going to be a packed one.

Kutsenko<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/hayleyleibson\/\">Hayley Leibson<\/a> have incredible tech pedigrees, but their latest venture involves as much digging in dirt as it does digging through lines of code.<\/p>\n<p>The two women have founded <a href=\"https:\/\/www.enterneverland.com\/\">Neverland<\/a>, a startup for the home gardener that aims to be a marketplace connecting mom and pop gardening shops with the explosion of amateur horticulturalists that have sprung up since the pandemic began and everyone needed someone (or something) to talk to.<\/p>\n<p>Gardening businesses were among the big winners during the pandemic, with sales at home and lawncare and gardening businesses shooting up 9% in 2020, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brecks.com\/blog\/covid-gardening-retail-boom\">according to data from the 200 year-old flower retailer, Breck&#8217;s<\/a>.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>It&#8217;s that surge in business, and the two co-founders own passion for home plants, that led to the launch of Neverland, the two founders said.<\/p>\n<p>For both, it&#8217;s a change of pace. Kutsenko studied computer science at Cornell, worked at Facebook on the Internet.org initiative and led teams working on the mobile app at Uber. Meanwhile, Leibson founded LunchClub and served as that company&#8217;s chief operating officer.<\/p>\n<p>Kutsenko and Leibson first connected through a women&#8217;s tech networking group in San Francisco and bonded over a shared love of plants. Leibson has roughly 24 plants in her apartment while Kutsenko had a plant nursery that she tended to herself.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We really view the opportunity for Neverland to be the sustainability focused marketplace,&#8221; said Leibson. &#8220;The power of what we&#8217;re doing is we&#8217;re able to create a really consistent support network for the consumer.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a huge market. Kutsenko said that globally plant and gardening spending is roughly $52 billion and $28 billion of that market is indoor and outdoor gardening.<\/p>\n<p>Using customer data, Neverland prompts users on how to optimize their gardens and horticulture activities based on their geography and what plants customers would want to grow. The company also looks to connect would-be green thumbed growers with companies in their region.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The educational piece we&#8217;re pulling from is the USDA agricultural APIs,&#8221; said Kutsenko. &#8220;We take and translate the super science-y terms into language that [customers] would understand. We&#8217;re pulling this from existing government resources and aggregating it and making it accessible to folks.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It was both the CVs of the founders and the overall size of the market that convinced investors to throw their financial weight behind the company &#8212; and it&#8217;s an impressive roster of consumer-focused and sustainability minded investors including: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obvious Ventures, Maveron, Kimbal Musk, and Y Combinator, which had Neverland in its most recent cohort. In all, Neverland managed to bring in $3 million for its marketplace and gardening community.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>And since everything starts with community, the company has managed to amass a healthy following on Instagram even before its scheduled launch this summer. Already 140,000 people follow Neverland&#8217;s posts. And the company has signed on 50 sellers in the Bay Area and beyond.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Vera Kutsenko and Hayley Leibson have incredible tech pedigrees, but their latest venture involves as much digging in dirt as it does digging through lines of code.

You start to negotiate the contract and everything sounds great except for one detail \u2014 your future employer refuses to say in what currency your salary would be paid. It could be U.S. dollars, euros, or perhaps Japanese yen, and you are expected to take a leap of faith and hope for fair pay. It sounds absurd, but this is exactly how the startup equity compensation market currently operates.<\/p>\n<p>The typical scenario is that employers offer a number of stock options or restricted stock units (RSUs) as part of an offer letter, but do not mention the company\u2019s total number of shares. Without this piece of information, employees cannot know whether their grants represent a 0.1% ownership stake, 0.01%, or any other percentage. Employees can ask for this information, but the employer is not required to provide it, and many startups simply don\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s not the end of it. Due to lack of proper disclosure requirements, employees are completely oblivious to the most salient form of startup valuation information \u2014 data describing the firm\u2019s capitalization table and aggregate liquidation preferences (which determine, in case the company is sold, how much money will be paid to investors before employees receive any payout). By not accounting for the debt-like properties of venture capital financing, employees tend to overestimate the value of their equity grants. This is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gsb.stanford.edu\/faculty-research\/publications\/squaring-venture-capital-valuations-reality\">especially relevant to employees of unicorn companies<\/a> because the type of terms that are common in late-stage financing have a dramatic and often misleading impact on the value of the company\u2019s common stock.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>What have regulators done to fix this? Not much. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.law.cornell.edu\/cfr\/text\/17\/230.701\">Under the current regulation<\/a>, the vast majority of startups are exempted from providing any information to their employees other than a copy of the options plan itself. A small percentage of startups that issue their employees more than $10 million worth of securities over a year period are required to provide additional disclosures including updated financial statements (two years of consolidated balance sheets, income statements, cash flows, and changes in stockholders\u2019 equity). These disclosures are likely to contain sensitive information about the startup but are only remotely related to the question of valuation that employees want answered. The company\u2019s most recent fair market valuation and the description of the employee\u2019s anticipated payout across various exit scenarios would convey far more useful information.<\/p>\n<p>The problem with the current regulation is not merely that it provides employees with either too much or too little information\u2014it is both and more. As the lyrics of Johnny Mathis and Deniece Williams\u2019 song go, it is \u201ctoo much, too little, too late.\u201d The regulation mandates the disclosure of too much irrelevant and potentially harmful information, too little material information, and the disclosure is delivered in a timeframe that does not permit efficient decision-making by employees (only after the employee has joined the company).<\/p>\n<p>This situation is unhealthy not only for employees themselves but also for the high-tech labor market as a whole. Talent is a scarce resource that companies of all sizes depend on. Lack of information impedes competition and slows down the flow of employees to better, more promising, opportunities. In the long run, employees\u2019 informational disadvantage can erode the value of equity incentives and make it all the more difficult for startups to compete for talent.<\/p>\n<p>In an article I published in the Columbia Business Law Review, titled, &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3492151\">Making Disclosure Work for Startup Employees<\/a>,&#8221; I argue that these problems have a relatively easy fix. Startups that issues over 10% of any class of shares to at least 100 employees should be required to disclose employees\u2019 individual payout according an exit waterfall analysis.<\/p>\n<p>Waterfall analysis describes the breakdown of cash flow distribution arrangements. In the case of startup finance, this analysis assumes that the company\u2019s equity is sold and the proceeds are allocated in a \u201cwaterfall\u201d down the different equity classes of shares, according to their respective liquidation preferences, until the common stockholders finally receive the residual claim, if any exists. While the information the model contains can be extremely complicated, the output is not. A waterfall model can render a graph where for each possible \u201cexit valuation\u201d plotted\u00a0on the x-axis, the employee\u2019s<b> <\/b>individualized \u201cpayout\u201d is indicated\u00a0on the y-axis. With the help of a cap table management platform, it is as simple as pressing a few mouse clicks.<\/p>\n<p>This visual representation will allow employees to understand how much they stand to gain across a range of exit values even if they don\u2019t understand the math and legal jargon that operate in the background. Armed with this information, employees would not need the traditional forms of disclosures now mandated by Rule 701, and startups could be relieved of the risk that the information contained in their financial statements would fall into the wrong hands. Critically, I also argue that employees should receive this information as part of the offer letter \u2013 before they choose whether to accept a job opportunity that includes an equity compensation component.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Earlier this year, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/rules\/proposed\/2020\/33-10891.pdf\">the SEC released proposed revisions to Rule 701<\/a>. The proposal includes many developments &#8211; among them the introduction of an alternative to the disclosure of financial statements. For startups that hit the threshold of issuing employees over $10 million worth of securities, the proposal allows choosing between disclosing financial statements and providing an independent valuation report of the securities\u2019 fair market value. According to the proposal, the latter should be determined by an independent appraisal consistent with the rules and regulations under Internal Revenue Code Section 409A.<\/p>\n<p>This is a step in the right direction \u2014 fair market valuation is far more useful to employees than the firm\u2019s financial statements. However, the disclosure of a 409A valuation in and of itself is just not enough. It is a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/03\/08\/business\/dealbook\/valuation-shell-game-silicon-valleys-dirty-secret.html\">well-known secret in Silicon Valley that 409A valuations are highly inaccurate<\/a>. Because the appraisal firm wishes to maintain a long-lasting business relationship with the company, and given that the valuation is based on information provided by the management team and is subject to board approval, the startup maintains nearly full control over the result. Therefore, the company\u2019s 409A valuation has informational value only when it includes the waterfall analysis that was used to generate the outcome. Moreover, the SEC&#8217;s proposal still allows the vast majority of startups (as long as they avoid the $10 million threshold) to offer equity grants without providing any meaningful disclosures. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>For over 30 years, the SEC has almost completely deregulated startup equity compensation in order to accommodate the ever growing need of startups to rely on equity in the war for talent. However, the SEC has and still is paying little attention to the other side of the employment equation\u2014employees\u2019 need for information regarding the value of their equity compensation. The time is ripe to revisit the protection of employees in their investor capacity under the securities regulatory regime.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Yifat Aran Contributor Share on Twitter Dr. Yifat Aran is a visiting scholar at the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, and an incoming Assistant Professor in Haifa University Faculty of Law.

Is it by creating micro-learning communities around shared loves? Is it about gamification? Aspirational learning has different incentives than for-credit learning.

Constantly competing for time leads to terrible engagement metrics and very high churn.

It feels so obvious that these spaces should exist for young people, but we\u2019ve lost sight of what students actually need. At my school, we built policies that assumed the worst in students. I want to flip that.

It\u2019s a step away from what Clearbanc originally flexed: the 20-minute term sheet and rapid-fire investment. I talk about some of the levers at play in my piece:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Many of Clearco\u2019s newest products are still in their infancy, but the potential success of the startup could nearly be tied to the general growth of startups looking for alternatives to venture capital when financing their startups. Similar to how AngelList\u2019s growth is neatly tied to the growth of emerging fund managers, Clearco\u2019s growth is cleanly related to the growth of founders who see financing as beyond a seed check from Y Combinator.<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/22\/how-are-vcs-handling-diligence-in-a-world-where-deals-open-and-close-in-days-not-months\/ \">How are VCs handling diligence in a world where deals open and close in days, not months<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/20\/clearbanc-unicorn-clearco\/ \">Clearbanc rebrands into a unicorn<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/23\/after-going-public-once-hot-startups-are-riding-a-valuation-roller-coaster\/\">After going public, once-hot startups are riding a valuation roller coaster<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2072256\" style=\"width: 799px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2072256\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout  wp-image-2072256\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/GettyImages-589134612.jpg\" alt=\"abstract human brain made out of dollar bills isolated on white background\" width=\"789\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/GettyImages-589134612.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/GettyImages-589134612.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/GettyImages-589134612.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/GettyImages-589134612.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/GettyImages-589134612.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/GettyImages-589134612.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 789px) 100vw, 789px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2072256\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Abstract human brain made out of dollar bills isolated on white background. <strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Iaremenko \/ Getty Images<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Don\u2019t market your opportunity away<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Keeping on the theme of tactical advice for founders, let\u2019s move onto talking about marketing.

evaluating new investment opportunities, as well as supporting the growth and strategy of current portfolio companies.\t<\/div>\n\t\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">This past year<\/span> has brought many new developments to a historically traditional process: taking a company public. Many of the standard levers in an initial public offering (IPO) are being redefined as we write.<\/p>\n<p>The emergence of direct listings is just one example. Even in more traditional IPOs, we have seen unique lock-up provisions, different auction approaches, virtual and rapid roadshows become the norm, and company-centric approaches to investor allocations.<\/p>\n<p>But clearly the most disruptive trend of the past 12 months has been the predominance of the special purpose acquisition company, commonly known as a SPAC. A SPAC is a company with no commercial operations that is formed strictly to raise capital through an IPO for the purpose of acquiring an existing, private company.<\/p>\n<p>Also known as &#8220;blank check companies,\u201d these entities typically have 24 months to find a company to buy or merge with.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tThe fundamental thing to remember about the SPAC process is that the result is a publicly traded company open to the regulatory environment of the SEC and the scrutiny of public shareholders.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>That process essentially makes the acquired company a publicly traded one. SPACs can, and generally do, raise additional capital in the form of a PIPE (private investment in public equity) in order to reaffirm the SPAC valuation and raise additional capital with the identified target company.<\/p>\n<p>SPACs have been around for decades, but they took the 2020 IPO market by storm. For some context: 2020 had more than 248 SPACs \u2014 more than the sum of the SPACs in the previous decade. While SPACs and the general sentiment around them continue to evolve, 2021 started off strong with 298 newly formed blank-check companies to date that have raised a collective $95 billion (versus $83 billion in 2020). It\u2019s worth noting that there has since been some slowdown in new SPAC formation and an uptick in regulatory caution. We expect such shifts to continue in these early days.<\/p>\n<p>For a SPAC, finding a company to merge with in 24 months might sound like a good amount of time, but in reality, the diligence and SEC process can easily consume six months or more. So identifying the target company relatively quickly becomes critical.

Kutsenko<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/hayleyleibson\/\">Hayley Leibson<\/a> have incredible tech pedigrees, but their latest venture involves as much digging in dirt as it does digging through lines of code.<\/p>\n<p>The two women have founded <a href=\"https:\/\/www.enterneverland.com\/\">Neverland<\/a>, a startup for the home gardener that aims to be a marketplace connecting mom and pop gardening shops with the explosion of amateur horticulturalists that have sprung up since the pandemic began and everyone needed someone (or something) to talk to.<\/p>\n<p>Gardening businesses were among the big winners during the pandemic, with sales at home and lawncare and gardening businesses shooting up 9% in 2020, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brecks.com\/blog\/covid-gardening-retail-boom\">according to data from the 200 year-old flower retailer, Breck&#8217;s<\/a>.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>It&#8217;s that surge in business, and the two co-founders own passion for home plants, that led to the launch of Neverland, the two founders said.<\/p>\n<p>For both, it&#8217;s a change of pace. Kutsenko studied computer science at Cornell, worked at Facebook on the Internet.org initiative and led teams working on the mobile app at Uber. Meanwhile, Leibson founded LunchClub and served as that company&#8217;s chief operating officer.<\/p>\n<p>Kutsenko and Leibson first connected through a women&#8217;s tech networking group in San Francisco and bonded over a shared love of plants. Leibson has roughly 24 plants in her apartment while Kutsenko had a plant nursery that she tended to herself.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We really view the opportunity for Neverland to be the sustainability focused marketplace,&#8221; said Leibson. &#8220;The power of what we&#8217;re doing is we&#8217;re able to create a really consistent support network for the consumer.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a huge market. Kutsenko said that globally plant and gardening spending is roughly $52 billion and $28 billion of that market is indoor and outdoor gardening.<\/p>\n<p>Using customer data, Neverland prompts users on how to optimize their gardens and horticulture activities based on their geography and what plants customers would want to grow. The company also looks to connect would-be green thumbed growers with companies in their region.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The educational piece we&#8217;re pulling from is the USDA agricultural APIs,&#8221; said Kutsenko. &#8220;We take and translate the super science-y terms into language that [customers] would understand. We&#8217;re pulling this from existing government resources and aggregating it and making it accessible to folks.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It was both the CVs of the founders and the overall size of the market that convinced investors to throw their financial weight behind the company &#8212; and it&#8217;s an impressive roster of consumer-focused and sustainability minded investors including: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obvious Ventures, Maveron, Kimbal Musk, and Y Combinator, which had Neverland in its most recent cohort. In all, Neverland managed to bring in $3 million for its marketplace and gardening community.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>And since everything starts with community, the company has managed to amass a healthy following on Instagram even before its scheduled launch this summer. Already 140,000 people follow Neverland&#8217;s posts. And the company has signed on 50 sellers in the Bay Area and beyond.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Vera Kutsenko and Hayley Leibson have incredible tech pedigrees, but their latest venture involves as much digging in dirt as it does digging through lines of code.

Apple executives on the 2021 iPad Pro, stunting with the M1 and creating headroom"},"content":{"rendered":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">When the third<\/span> minute of Apple\u2019s first product event of 2021 ticked over and they had already made 3 announcements we knew it was going to be a packed one. In a tight <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/20\/heres-everything-apple-announced-at-its-spring-loaded-event-today\/\">single hour this week<\/a>, Apple launched a ton of new product including AirTags, new Apple Card family sharing, a new Apple TV, a new set of colorful iMacs, and a purple iPhone 12 shade.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Of the new devices announced, though, Apple\u2019s new 12.9\u201d iPad Pro is the most interesting from a market positioning perspective.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This week I got a chance to speak to Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Greg Joswiak and Senior Vice President of Hardware Engineering John Ternus about this latest version of the iPad Pro and its place in the working universe of computing professionals.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">In many ways, this new iPad Pro is the equivalent of a sprinter being lengths ahead going into the last lap and just turning on the afterburners to put a undebatable distance between themselves and the rest of the pack. Last year\u2019s model is still one of the best computers you can buy, with a densely packed offering of powerful computing tools, battery performance and portability. And this year gets upgrades in the M1 processor, RAM, storage speed, Thunderbolt connection, 5G radio, new ultra wide front camera and its Liquid Retina XDR display.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This is a major bump even while the 2020 iPad Pro still dominates the field. And at the center of that is the display.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Apple has essentially ported its enormously good $5,000 Pro Display XDR down to a 12.9\u201d touch version, with some slight improvements. But the specs are flat out incredible. 1,000 nit brightness peaking at 1,600 nits in HDR with 2,500 full array local dimming zones \u2014 compared to the Pro Display XDR\u2019s 576 in a much larger scale.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Given that this year\u2019s first product launch from Apple was virtual, the media again got no immediate hands on with the new devices introduced, including iPad Pro. This means that I have not yet seen the XDR display in action. Unfortunately, these specs are so good that estimating them without having seen the screen yet is akin to trying to visualize \u201ca trillion\u201d in your head. It\u2019s intellectually possible but not really practical.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s brighter than any Mac or iOS device on the market and could be a big game shifting device for professionals working in HDR video and photography. But even still, this is a major investment to ship a micro-LED display in the millions or tens of millions of units with more density and brightness than any other display on the market.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I ask both of them why there\u2019s a need to do this doubling down on what is already one of the best portable displays ever made \u2014 if not one of the best displays period.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.02-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2143477\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.02-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.02-1.jpg 3600w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.02-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.02-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.02-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.02-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.02-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.02-1.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.02-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWe&#8217;ve always tried to have the best display,\u201d says Ternus. \u201cWe&#8217;re going from the best display on any device like this and making it even better, because that&#8217;s what we do and that&#8217;s why we, we love coming to work every day is to take that next big step.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201c[With the] Pro Display XDR if you remember one thing we talked about was being able to have this display and this capability in more places in the work stream. Because traditionally there was just this one super expensive reference monitor at the end of the line. This is like the next extreme of that now you don&#8217;t even have to be in the studio anymore you can take it with you on the go and you can have that capability so from a, from a creative pro standpoint we think this is going to be huge.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In my use of the Pro Display and my conversations with professionals about it one of the the common themes that I\u2019ve heard is the reduction in overall workload due to the multiple points in the flow where color and image can be managed accurately to spec now. The general system in place puts a reference monitor very late in the production stage which can often lead to expensive and time consuming re-rendering or new color passes. Adding the Liquid Retina XDR display into the mix at an extremely low price point means that a lot more plot points on the production line suddenly get a lot closer to the right curve.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">One of the stronger answers on the \u2018why the aggressive spec bump\u2019 question comes later in our discussion but is worth mentioning in this context. The point, Joswiak says, is to offer headroom. Headroom for users and headroom for developers.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cOne of the things that iPad Pro has done as John [Ternus] has talked about is push the envelope. And by pushing the envelope that has created this space for developers to come in and fill it. When we created the very first iPad Pro, there was no Photoshop,\u201d Joswiak notes. \u201cThere was no creative apps that could immediately use it. But now there&#8217;s so many you can&#8217;t count. Because we created that capability, we created that performance \u2014 and, by the way sold a fairly massive number of them \u2014 which is a pretty good combination for developers to then come in and say, I can take advantage of that. There&#8217;s enough customers here and there&#8217;s enough performance. I know how to use that. And that&#8217;s the same thing we do with each generation. We create more headroom to performance that developers will figure out how to use.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThe customer is in a great spot because they know they&#8217;re buying something that&#8217;s got some headroom and developers love it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.John_Ternus.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2143480\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.John_Ternus.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.John_Ternus.jpg 3600w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.John_Ternus.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.John_Ternus.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.John_Ternus.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.John_Ternus.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.John_Ternus.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.John_Ternus.jpg?resize=2048,1151 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.John_Ternus.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The iPad Pro is now powered by the M1 chip \u2014 a move away from the A-series naming. And that processor part is identical (given similar memory configurations) to the one found in the iMac announced this week and MacBooks launched earlier this year.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIt&#8217;s the same part, it&#8217;s M1,\u201d says Ternus. \u201ciPad Pro has always had the best Apple silicon we make.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cHow crazy is it that you can take a chip that&#8217;s in a desktop, and drop it into an iPad,\u201d says Joswiak. \u201cI mean it&#8217;s just incredible to have that kind of performance at such amazing power efficiency. And then have all the technologies that come with it. To have the neural engine and ISP and Thunderbolt and all these amazing things that come with it, it&#8217;s just miles beyond what anybody else is doing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As the M1 was rolling out and I <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/17\/yeah-apples-m1-macbook-pro-is-powerful-but-its-the-battery-life-that-will-blow-you-away\/\">began running my testing<\/a>, the power per watt aspects really became the story. That really is the big differentiator for M1. For decades, laptop users have been accustomed to saving any heavy or intense workloads for the times when their machines were plugged in due to power consumption. M1 is in the process of resetting those expectations for desktop class processors. In fact, Apple is offering not only the most powerful CPUs but also the most power-efficient CPUs on the market. And it\u2019s doing it in a $700 Mac Mini, a $1,700 iMac and a $1,100 iPad Pro <a href=\"https:\/\/www.extremetech.com\/computing\/322120-apples-m1-positioning-mocks-every-x86-cpu-amd-and-intel-have-ever-launched\">at the same time<\/a>. It\u2019s a pretty ridiculous display of stunting, but it\u2019s also the product of more than a decade of work building its own architecture and silicon.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYour battery life is defined by the capacity of your battery and the efficiency of your system right? So we&#8217;re always pushing really really hard on the system efficiency and obviously with M1, the team&#8217;s done a tremendous job with that. But the display as well. We designed a new mini LED for this display, focusing on efficiency and on package size, obviously, to really to be able to make sure that it could fit into the iPad experience with the iPad experience\u2019s good battery life.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;We weren&#8217;t going to compromise on that,\u201d says Ternus.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">One of the marquee features of the new iPad Pro is its 12MP ultra-wide camera with Center Stage. An auto-centering and cropping video feature designed to make FaceTime calling more human-centric, literally. It finds humans in the frame and centers their faces, keeping them in the frame even if they move, standing and stretching or leaning to the side. It also includes additional people in the frame automatically if they enter the range of the new ultra-wide 12MP front-facing camera. And yes, it also works with other apps like Zoom and Webex and there will be an API for it.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I\u2019ve gotten to see it in action a bit more and I can say with surety that this will become an industry standard implementation of this kind of subject focusing. The crop mechanic is handled with taste, taking on the characteristics of a smooth zoom pulled by a steady hand rather than an abrupt cut to a smaller, closer framing. It really is like watching a TV show directed by an invisible machine learning engine.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThis is one of the examples of some of our favorite stuff to do because of the way it marries the hardware and software right,\u201d Ternus says. \u201cSo, sure it&#8217;s the camera but it&#8217;s also the SOC and and the algorithms associated with detecting the person and panning and zooming. There&#8217;s the kind of the taste aspect, right? Which is; how do we make something that feels good it doesn&#8217;t move too fast and doesn&#8217;t move too slow. That\u2019s a lot of talented, creative people coming together and trying to find the thing that makes it Apple like.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2143483\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg 3600w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/AppleEvent.APR20Keynote.Raja_Bose.01-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It also goes a long way to masking the awkward horizontal camera placement when using the iPad Pro with Magic Keyboard. This has been a big drawback for using the iPad Pro as a portable video conferencing tool, something we\u2019ve all been doing a lot of lately. I ask Ternus whether Center Stage was designed to mitigate this placement.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWell, you can use iPad in any orientation right? So you&#8217;re going to have different experiences based on how you&#8217;re using it. But what&#8217;s amazing about this is that we can keep correcting the frame. What&#8217;s been really cool is that we&#8217;ve all been sitting around in these meetings all day long on video conferencing and it&#8217;s just nice to get up. This experience of just being able to stand up and kind of stretch and move around the room without walking away from the camera has been just absolutely game changing, it&#8217;s really cool.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s worth noting that several other video sharing devices like the Portal and some video software like Teams already offer cropping-type follow features, but the user experience is everything when you\u2019re shipping software like this to millions of people at once. It will be interesting to see how Center Stage stacks up agains the competition when we see it live.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">With the ongoing chatter about how the iPad Pro and Mac are converging from a feature-set perspective, I ask how they would you characterize an iPad Pro vs. a MacBook buyer? Joswiak is quick to respond to this one.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThis is my favorite question because you know, you have one camp of people who believe that the iPad and the Mac are at war with one another right it&#8217;s one or the other to the death. And then you have others who are like, no, they&#8217;re bringing them together \u2014 they&#8217;re forcing them into one single platform and there&#8217;s a grand conspiracy here,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThey are at opposite ends of a thought spectrum and the reality is that neither is correct. We pride ourselves in the fact that we work really, really, really hard to have the best products in the respective categories. The Mac is the best personal computer, it just is. Customer satisfaction would indicate that is the case, by a longshot.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Joswiak points out that the whole PC category is growing, which he says is nice to see. But he points out that Macs are way outgrowing PCs and doing \u2018quite well\u2019. He also notes that the iPad business is still outgrowing the tablets category (while still refusing to label the iPad a tablet).<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cAnd it\u2019s also the case that it&#8217;s not an \u2018either or\u2019. The majority of our Mac customers have an iPad. That&#8217;s an awesome thing. They don&#8217;t have it because they&#8217;re replacing their Mac, it&#8217;s because they use the right tool at the right time.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">What&#8217;s very cool about what [Ternus] and his team have done with iPad Pro is that they&#8217;ve created something where that&#8217;s still the case for creative professionals too \u2014 the hardest to please audience. They\u2019ve given them a tool where they can be equally at home using the Mac for their professional making money with it kind of work, and now they can pick up an iPad Pro \u2014 and they have been for multiple generations now and do things that, again, are part of how they make money, part of their creative workflow flow,\u201d says Joswiak. \u201cAnd that test is exciting. it isn&#8217;t one or the other, both of them have a role for these people.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Since converting over to an iPad Pro <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/24\/review-100000-miles-and-one-week-with-an-ipad-pro\/\">as my only portable computer<\/a>, I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about the multimodal aspects of professional work. And, clearly, Apple has as well given its launch <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/05\/apples-2019-imac-pro-will-be-shaped-by-workflows\/\">of a Pro Workflows team<\/a> back in 2018. Workflows have changed massively over the last decade, and obviously the iPhone and an iPad, with their popularization of the direct manipulation paradigm, have had everything to do with that. In the current world we\u2019re in, we\u2019re way past \u2018what is this new thing\u2019, and we&#8217;re even way past \u2018oh cool, this feels normal\u2019 and we\u2019re well into \u2018this feels vital, it feels necessary.\u2019<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;Contrary to some people&#8217;s beliefs, we&#8217;re never thinking about what we should not do on an iPad because we don&#8217;t want to encroach on Mac or vice versa,\u201d says Ternus. \u201cOur focus is, what is the best way? What is the best iPad we can make what are the best Macs we can make. Some people are going to work across both of them, some people will kind of lean towards one because it better suits their needs and that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s all good.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you follow along, you\u2019ll know that Apple studiously refuses to enter into the iPad vs. Mac debate \u2014 and in fact likes to place the iPad in a special place in the market that exists unchallenged. Joswiak often says that he doesn\u2019t even like to say the word tablet.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThere\u2019s iPads and tablets, and tablets aren\u2019t very good. iPads are great,\u201d Joswiak says. \u201cWe&#8217;re always pushing the boundaries with iPad Pro, and that&#8217;s what you want leaders to do. Leaders are the ones that push the boundaries leaders are the ones that take this further than has ever been taken before and the XDR display is a great example of that. Who else would you expect to do that other than us. And then once you see it, and once you use it, you won&#8217;t wonder, you\u2019ll be glad we did.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Image Credits: Apple<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When the third minute of Apple\u2019s first product event of 2021 ticked over and they had already made 3 announcements we knew it was going to be a packed one.

social audio is just the latest version of the story of podcasting. Take the idea that podcasting is experiencing a new wave of popularity and scaffolding. Are you sure? Apple is bent on turning the space into a subscription model, and we&#8217;re all going to twist again like we did last summer. Somehow I doubt it. The basic attraction for me is not paying for podcasts. Subscription startups may be an important step forward, but the heart of the matter is talent formation.<\/p>\n<p>Back when they first started, the real charge was the ability to own the whole stack: writer, producer, editor, star, and marketer. Making money for this may have been a future goal, but right now the real power was in figuring out what might work without the intrusion of what people other than yourself thought about the product. Only if something made itself apparent was it necessary to address the needs and wants of the audience.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Luckily, that ruled out about ninety percent of the resulting wave of stuff.  There were Ted talks, or what became Ted talks, well thought out verbal slide decks in an 8 minute payload that grabbed, shook, and exacted payment in credibility and validation of the expertise of the artist. Always lurking was the question of what day job the author was moonlighting from. Many self help business books emerged from this.<\/p>\n<p>Then there were the professionals, the public radio folks who knew how to do this in their sleep but were looking for a role not dependent on grant writing or public liberal funding. Reporters who knew how to squeeze out a story, producers who mined their rolodex to fashion a conversation, screenwriters looking for momentum to bank a shot off studio executives to get a pilot or series starter commitment. Eventually this added up to enough successful podcasts to attract sponsorship support from audiobooks and publishing services. Scripted shows became farm clubs for independent talent aiming for the Big Show. This endured for 20 years.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Beatles transformed the music business from a vaudeville-like zero-sum game to a Renaissance of control over writing, performing, promoting, and touring. Aspiration was the fuel of the business model, obviating the need for incremental success in favor of explosive momentum and dominance of the media. Hair, boots, sex, striking fear in the hearts of parents and then politicians everywhere. Sgt. Pepper and Kubrick created a version of the future that made everything else pale by comparison. That it all crashed and burned was just one of the risks of what became the startup culture in Silicon Valley and Route 128.<\/p>\n<p>In today&#8217;s world of NFTs and Decacorns, free still has a reason for believing. The old guard of the blogging world have reinvented themselves as Lone Rangers in the creator economy. Slap a badge on that podcast and hitch a ride on the promise of endless subscription growth, minus 10% per newsletter sub or 30% for the first year in the AppStore. It&#8217;s not the long tail, so what is it? To be sure, the world will endorse the talented solitary surfers, armed with MG Sieglerian talent for the suite spot of the tech zeitgeist, the revolutionary zeal of the breakthrough synthesists of the political, lyrical, and comic survivalists.<\/p>\n<p>How will the media compensate for the loss of their gatekeeper status? For starters, the more the stampede accelerates, the bundlers will storm the economics with constructs that look very much like the magazines and social destinations they replace. As crypto enters the bloodstream, streaming will generate a new measure of success and equity for the artists. Free will still be the driver of the form, but transitional models like tip jars will migrate to social capital to be banked by investors betting on the future success of the talent.<\/p>\n<p>Even this early, some things have to change. The no recording conceit is an artifact of the launch stage, soon to be jettisoned when the effort reaches escape velocity. Clubhouse gains much of its critical mass from who rather than how many are swarming; interesting combinations of speakers and listeners weigh more tellingly than the raw numbers of name guests and moderators. Live is important, but committing to the voice of the artist is a calculation of time, window of opportunity, relevance to the emotion and tenor of the times. And the competitive landscape for that attention spans so many of the medias being replaced or transformed by the application of free.<\/p>\n<p>None of this means the newsletter and conversation startups won&#8217;t succeed. Subscribing gives us something to consume to justify the tithe, and most people who drop streaming subs replace them with another service. As these services proliferate, competition drives innovation and expansion into events and paradigm shifts like Netflix and SPACs. Witness TechCrunch, built on just the dynamics Substack and Revue-Twitter now make accessible to a new wave of Arringtons.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><em>from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getrevue.co\/profile\/gillmorgang\/issues\/gillmor-gang-newsletter-revue-5-514665\"> Gillmor Gang Newsletter<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">__________________<\/p>\n<p>The Gillmor Gang \u2014 Frank Radice, Michael Markman, Keith Teare, Denis Pombriant, Brent Leary and Steve Gillmor.

It\u2019s broadly based on <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/the-exchange\/\">the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch<\/a>, but free, and made for your weekend reading.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>A week ago <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/14\/pico-2-0\/\">TechCrunch covered<\/a> Pico\u2019s $6.5 million funding round and described it as \u201ca New York startup that helps online creators and media companies make money and manage their customer data.\u201d The Exchange <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/08\/as-media-revenue-struggles-subscription-startups-see-growth\/\">has also covered Pico before<\/a>, most recently during a mid-2020 dive into the world of indie pubs and subscription media.<\/p>\n<p>While our own Anthony Ha did an inimitable job covering the <a href=\"https:\/\/trypico.com\/\">Pico<\/a> round, I got on a Zoom call with the company, as well, as their new capital came with <a href=\"https:\/\/trypico.com\/blog\/company\/2-0\">a relaunch of sorts<\/a> that I wanted to better understand.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"44A5cEGiR1\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/19\/european-vc-soars-in-q1\/\">European VC soars in Q1<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;European VC soars in Q1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/19\/european-vc-soars-in-q1\/embed\/#?secret=44A5cEGiR1\" data-secret=\"44A5cEGiR1\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The Pico team walked me through what\u2019s changed at their business by describing the historical progress of creative digital tooling. They said earlier eras in the space focused on content hosting and distribution. In the startup\u2019s view, a new generation of creative-focused tooling will bring the market to an era in which content management systems, or CMSs &#8212; say, Substack or WordPress &#8212; will not own the center of tooling. Instead, monetization will.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s Pico\u2019s bet, and so it\u2019s building what it considers to be an operating system for the creator market. My gut read is that a creative digital world that centers around monetization sounds like one that is more lucrative than what preceding eras brought us.<\/p>\n<p>Pico\u2019s view is that regardless of where someone first builds their audience, they eventually go multi-SKU &#8212; or multi-platform, perhaps &#8212; so keeping a single, centralized register of customer data may prove critical.<\/p>\n<p>The startup\u2019s revamped service is a bit of a monetization tool, as before, along with a creator-focused CRM that sits atop your CMS or other digital output on any particular platform. So far customer growth at the company looks good, growing by about 5x in the last year. Let\u2019s see how far Pico can ride its vision, and if it can help build out a <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2020\/12\/the-creator-economy-needs-a-middle-class\">middle class in the creator economy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>The grocery revolution will be IRL<\/h2>\n<p>Somewhat lost in our circles amid the hype regarding <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/02\/instacart-raises-265m-at-a-39b-valuation\/\">Instacart\u2019s epic COVID period<\/a> is the fact that most folks still go to stores to buy their fruit and veg, as our friends in the UK might say.<\/p>\n<p>Grocers did not forget the fact. But their historically thin margins and rising competition for customer ownership in the Instacart era hasn\u2019t left them too secure. How can they pursue a more digitally enabled strategy without outsourcing their customer relationship to a third party?<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.swiftly.com\/\">Swiftly<\/a> might be part of the answer. The startup is building technology that may help grocery chains of all sizes go digital, take advantage of modern mobile technology, and generate more incomes via ads, while offering consumers more shopping options. Neat, yeah?<\/p>\n<p>The startup has raised a little over $15 million to date, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/swiftly-7640\/company_financials\">per Crunchbase data<\/a>, but came back into our minds thanks to the launch of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.swiftly.com\/assets\/built\/dollar-tree-inc-press-release-chesapeake-media-group-final.pdf\">a deal with the Dollar Tree company<\/a>, a consumer retailer that has around one zillion stores in America.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"R13W2bRu5p\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/22\/how-are-vcs-handling-diligence-in-a-world-where-deals-open-and-close-in-days-not-months\/\">How are VCs handling diligence in a world where deals open and close in days, not months?<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;How are VCs handling diligence in a world where deals open and close in days, not months?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/22\/how-are-vcs-handling-diligence-in-a-world-where-deals-open-and-close-in-days-not-months\/embed\/#?secret=R13W2bRu5p\" data-secret=\"R13W2bRu5p\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>I\u2019ve been aware of Swiftly for ages, having met its co-founder <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/henry-kim\">Henry Kim<\/a> back when he was building <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sneakpeeq.com\/\">Sneakpeeq<\/a>, which later became <a href=\"https:\/\/www.symphonycommerce.com\/\">Symphony Commerce<\/a>. The latter company was eventually <a href=\"https:\/\/www.symphonycommerce.com\/blog\/quantum-retail-technology-inc-announces-acquisition-of-symphony-commerce\/\">bought by Quantum Retail<\/a>. But during my chats with Kim over the years in and around San Francisco, he consistently brought up the grocery market, a space he\u2019d had experience in before building Symphony Commerce.<\/p>\n<p>After hearing Kim hype up the possibilities for grocery and digital for a half decade or so, to see the company that came out of his hopes and planning land a major partner is fun.<\/p>\n<p>Swiftly provides two main products, a retail system and a media service. The retail side of its business provides checkout services, loyalty programs, personalized offers and the like for mobile shoppers. And the media side allows IRL grocers to snag a bit of the consumer packaged goods (CPG) ad spend that they often miss out on, while looping in analytics to provide better attribution to the impact of ads sold.<\/p>\n<p>I expect that Swiftly will raise more capital in the next few quarters now that it has a big, public deal out. More when we have it.<\/p>\n<h2>UiPath, SPACs, and a neat venture capital round<\/h2>\n<p>Over the past two weeks The Exchange has written quite a lot about the UiPath IPO. Probably too much. But to catch you up just in case, the company\u2019s first IPO pricing range <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/12\/uipaths-first-ipo-pricing-could-be-a-warning-to-late-stage-investors\/\">looked like a warning<\/a> for late-stage investors as the resulting valuations were a bit lower than anticipated. Next the company <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/19\/uipath-raises-ipo-range-still-targets-lower-valuation-than-final-private-round\/\">raised that range<\/a>, ameliorating if not eliminating our earlier concern. Then the company <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/21\/a-cooling-trend-in-public-markets-makes-uipaths-down-round-ipo-a-win-for-the-company\/\">priced above its raised range<\/a>, though still at a discount to its final private round. Then it gained ground after starting to trade, and its CFO was like, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/21\/as-uipath-closes-above-its-final-private-valuation-cfo-ashim-gupta-discusses-his-companys-path-to-market\/\">we did good<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>To dig even more into the company\u2019s private-public valuation saga, The Exchange asked B2B investor <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dthakker02?lang=en\">Dharmesh Thakker<\/a>, a general partner at Battery Ventures, about his take on the company\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/01\/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation\/\">final private round<\/a> in the context of it landing a bit higher than where the company eventually priced its IPO. Here\u2019s what he had to say:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>[T]here was smart money involved in that round. These are people who understand that material value creation happens 3-5 years post IPO, as we have seen with Twilio, Atlassian, MongoDB, Okta, and Crowdstrike who have increased value 5-10x post IPO.<\/p>\n<p>Right now, UIPath has only 1% penetration at $608M revenue in a $60B automation market, and the urgency around intelligent process automation for repetitive tasks is only increasing post-COVID. Companies need help managing their costs with automation. So, as the company penetrates its target market and grows over time, UIPath will drive ongoing value, which pre-IPO and IPO stage investors realize. They will be patient.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>He\u2019s bullish, in other words. A more acerbic take on the UiPath IPO came in from PitchBook analyst <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/brendanmcburke\/\">Brendan Burke<\/a>. Here\u2019s what he had to say about the company and its market:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>RPA has scaled rapidly due to the demand for automation yet remains a limited solution that may lack durable value. Due to its reliance on custom scripts, we view RPA as a bridge technology to cloud-native AI automation that faces competitive risk from AI-native challengers. The future of enterprise automation is for front-line users to deploy cloud-native machine learning models that can adapt to dynamic data streams and make accurate decisions. UiPath\u2019s implementations are not cloud-native and require third party integrations with around 75 AI model vendors for intelligent decision-making. Additionally, the company lists the ability to recruit AI engineers as a risk factor for the business. UiPath\u2019s ability to expand across the AI value chain will be critical for its long-term prospects.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I include that remark as it can be, at times, hard to get actual negative commentary out of the broader analyst world, as people are so terrified of being rude.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"QmzRzm7CUa\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/20\/insurtech-startups-are-leveraging-rapid-growth-to-raise-big-money\/\">Insurtech startups are leveraging rapid growth to raise big money<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Insurtech startups are leveraging rapid growth to raise big money&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/20\/insurtech-startups-are-leveraging-rapid-growth-to-raise-big-money\/embed\/#?secret=QmzRzm7CUa\" data-secret=\"QmzRzm7CUa\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Scooting along, there\u2019s a new SPAC deal out this week that I wanted to flag for you: SmartRent is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/smartrent-to-go-public-in-2-2-billion-merger-with-fifth-wall-acquisition-corp-i-accelerating-growth-of-category-leading-smart-home-technology-for-the-global-real-estate-industry-301274559.html\">merging<\/a> with Fifth Wall Acquisition Corp. I. SmartRent raised more than $100 million while private, according to Crunchbase data, from RET Ventures, Spark Capital and Bain Capital Ventures, among others.<\/p>\n<p>So this particular SPAC deal, which puts a $2.2 billion equity valuation on SmartRent, is a material venture-backed exit. You can check its investor deck <a href=\"https:\/\/s27.q4cdn.com\/632832908\/files\/doc_presentations\/Investor-Presentation.pdf\">here<\/a>. We care about the company as it appears to work in a similar space to Latch, which is also going out via a SPAC. Dueling OS companies for rental units? This should be fun.

Among all the venture capital rounds that I wish I could have written about this week but didn\u2019t get to, HYPR is up there because it promises a password-free future.

the MasterClass effect means for edtech"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">MasterClass, which sells<\/span> a subscription to celebrity-taught classes, sits on the cusp of entertainment and education. It offers virtual, yet aspirational learning: an online tennis class with Serena Williams, a cooking session with Gordon Ramsay. While there\u2019s the off chance that an instructor might actually talk to you &#8212; <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/20\/masterclass-just-raised-100-million-for-celebrity-fueled-content\/\">it has happened before<\/a> &#8212; the platform mostly just offers paywalled documentary-style content.<\/p>\n<p>The vision has received attention. MasterClass is raising funding that would value it at $2.5 billion, as scooped by Axios and confirmed independently by a source to TechCrunch. But while MasterClass has found a sweet spot, can the success be replicated?<\/p>\n<p>Investors certainly think so. Outlier, founded by MasterClass\u2019 co-founder,<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/22\/outlier-series-b\/\"> closed a $30 million Series C this week<\/a>, for affordable, digital college courses. The similarities between Outlier and its founder\u2019s alma mater aren\u2019t subtle: It\u2019s literally trying to apply MasterClass\u2019 high-quality videography to college classes. This comes a week after I wrote about a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/15\/garry-kasparov-launches-a-community-first-chess-platform\/\">&#8220;MasterClass for Chess lovers&#8221;<\/a> platform launched by former Chess World Champion Garry Kasparov.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Two back-to-back MasterClass copycats raising millions in venture capital makes me think about if the model can truly be verticalized and focused down into specific niches. After 2020 and the rise of Zoom University, we know<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/18\/edtech-zoom-university\/\"> edtech needs to be more engaging<\/a>, but we don\u2019t know the exact way to get there. Is it by creating micro-learning communities around shared loves? Is it about gamification? Aspirational learning has different incentives than for-credit learning. In order to be successful, Outlier needs to prove to universities it can use MasterClass magic for true outcomes that rival in-person lectures. It&#8217;s a harder, and more ambtious promise.<\/p>\n<p>My riff aside, I turned to two edtech founders to understand how they see the MasterClass effect panning out, and to cross-check my gut reaction.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Taylor_Nieman\">Taylor Nieman<\/a>, the founder of language learning startup Toucan:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Although I do love how these models try to lean into this theme of &#8220;invisible learning&#8221; like we leverage with Toucan, it faces the same issues as so many other consumer products that try to steal time out of people&#8217;s very busy days. Constantly competing for time leads to terrible engagement metrics and very high churn. That leads me to question what true learning outcomes could occur from little to no usage of the product itself.<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AmandaDoAmanda\">Amanda DoAmaral<\/a>, the founder of Fiveable, a learning platform for high school students:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Masterclass is important for showing us why educational content should be treated more like entertainment. All of our bars for content quality is much higher now than it ever was before and I\u2019m excited to see how that affects learning across the board.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>For students, it\u2019s about creating environments that support them holistically and giving them space to collaborate openly. It feels so obvious that these spaces should exist for young people, but we\u2019ve lost sight of what students actually need. At my school, we built policies that assumed the worst in students. I want to flip that. Assume the best, be proactive to keep them safe, and create ways to react when we need to.<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Anyways, that\u2019s just some nuance to chew on during this fine day. In the rest of this newsletter, we will focus a lot on tactical advice for founders, from the money they raise to the peacock dance they might want to do one day.

She earned her JSD from Stanford Law School where her dissertation focused on equity-based compensation in Silicon Valley startups.\t<\/div>\n\t\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><p id=\"speakable-summary\">Imagine that you get a job offer at your dream company. You start to negotiate the contract and everything sounds great except for one detail \u2014 your future employer refuses to say in what currency your salary would be paid. It could be U.S. dollars, euros, or perhaps Japanese yen, and you are expected to take a leap of faith and hope for fair pay. It sounds absurd, but this is exactly how the startup equity compensation market currently operates.<\/p>\n<p>The typical scenario is that employers offer a number of stock options or restricted stock units (RSUs) as part of an offer letter, but do not mention the company\u2019s total number of shares. Without this piece of information, employees cannot know whether their grants represent a 0.1% ownership stake, 0.01%, or any other percentage. Employees can ask for this information, but the employer is not required to provide it, and many startups simply don\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s not the end of it. Due to lack of proper disclosure requirements, employees are completely oblivious to the most salient form of startup valuation information \u2014 data describing the firm\u2019s capitalization table and aggregate liquidation preferences (which determine, in case the company is sold, how much money will be paid to investors before employees receive any payout). By not accounting for the debt-like properties of venture capital financing, employees tend to overestimate the value of their equity grants. This is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gsb.stanford.edu\/faculty-research\/publications\/squaring-venture-capital-valuations-reality\">especially relevant to employees of unicorn companies<\/a> because the type of terms that are common in late-stage financing have a dramatic and often misleading impact on the value of the company\u2019s common stock.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>What have regulators done to fix this? Not much. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.law.cornell.edu\/cfr\/text\/17\/230.701\">Under the current regulation<\/a>, the vast majority of startups are exempted from providing any information to their employees other than a copy of the options plan itself. A small percentage of startups that issue their employees more than $10 million worth of securities over a year period are required to provide additional disclosures including updated financial statements (two years of consolidated balance sheets, income statements, cash flows, and changes in stockholders\u2019 equity). These disclosures are likely to contain sensitive information about the startup but are only remotely related to the question of valuation that employees want answered. The company\u2019s most recent fair market valuation and the description of the employee\u2019s anticipated payout across various exit scenarios would convey far more useful information.<\/p>\n<p>The problem with the current regulation is not merely that it provides employees with either too much or too little information\u2014it is both and more. As the lyrics of Johnny Mathis and Deniece Williams\u2019 song go, it is \u201ctoo much, too little, too late.\u201d The regulation mandates the disclosure of too much irrelevant and potentially harmful information, too little material information, and the disclosure is delivered in a timeframe that does not permit efficient decision-making by employees (only after the employee has joined the company).<\/p>\n<p>This situation is unhealthy not only for employees themselves but also for the high-tech labor market as a whole. Talent is a scarce resource that companies of all sizes depend on. Lack of information impedes competition and slows down the flow of employees to better, more promising, opportunities. In the long run, employees\u2019 informational disadvantage can erode the value of equity incentives and make it all the more difficult for startups to compete for talent.<\/p>\n<p>In an article I published in the Columbia Business Law Review, titled, &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3492151\">Making Disclosure Work for Startup Employees<\/a>,&#8221; I argue that these problems have a relatively easy fix. Startups that issues over 10% of any class of shares to at least 100 employees should be required to disclose employees\u2019 individual payout according an exit waterfall analysis.<\/p>\n<p>Waterfall analysis describes the breakdown of cash flow distribution arrangements. In the case of startup finance, this analysis assumes that the company\u2019s equity is sold and the proceeds are allocated in a \u201cwaterfall\u201d down the different equity classes of shares, according to their respective liquidation preferences, until the common stockholders finally receive the residual claim, if any exists. While the information the model contains can be extremely complicated, the output is not. A waterfall model can render a graph where for each possible \u201cexit valuation\u201d plotted\u00a0on the x-axis, the employee\u2019s<b> <\/b>individualized \u201cpayout\u201d is indicated\u00a0on the y-axis. With the help of a cap table management platform, it is as simple as pressing a few mouse clicks.<\/p>\n<p>This visual representation will allow employees to understand how much they stand to gain across a range of exit values even if they don\u2019t understand the math and legal jargon that operate in the background. Armed with this information, employees would not need the traditional forms of disclosures now mandated by Rule 701, and startups could be relieved of the risk that the information contained in their financial statements would fall into the wrong hands. Critically, I also argue that employees should receive this information as part of the offer letter \u2013 before they choose whether to accept a job opportunity that includes an equity compensation component.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Earlier this year, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/rules\/proposed\/2020\/33-10891.pdf\">the SEC released proposed revisions to Rule 701<\/a>. The proposal includes many developments &#8211; among them the introduction of an alternative to the disclosure of financial statements. For startups that hit the threshold of issuing employees over $10 million worth of securities, the proposal allows choosing between disclosing financial statements and providing an independent valuation report of the securities\u2019 fair market value. According to the proposal, the latter should be determined by an independent appraisal consistent with the rules and regulations under Internal Revenue Code Section 409A.<\/p>\n<p>This is a step in the right direction \u2014 fair market valuation is far more useful to employees than the firm\u2019s financial statements. However, the disclosure of a 409A valuation in and of itself is just not enough. It is a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/03\/08\/business\/dealbook\/valuation-shell-game-silicon-valleys-dirty-secret.html\">well-known secret in Silicon Valley that 409A valuations are highly inaccurate<\/a>. Because the appraisal firm wishes to maintain a long-lasting business relationship with the company, and given that the valuation is based on information provided by the management team and is subject to board approval, the startup maintains nearly full control over the result. Therefore, the company\u2019s 409A valuation has informational value only when it includes the waterfall analysis that was used to generate the outcome. Moreover, the SEC&#8217;s proposal still allows the vast majority of startups (as long as they avoid the $10 million threshold) to offer equity grants without providing any meaningful disclosures. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>For over 30 years, the SEC has almost completely deregulated startup equity compensation in order to accommodate the ever growing need of startups to rely on equity in the war for talent. However, the SEC has and still is paying little attention to the other side of the employment equation\u2014employees\u2019 need for information regarding the value of their equity compensation. The time is ripe to revisit the protection of employees in their investor capacity under the securities regulatory regime.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Yifat Aran Contributor Share on Twitter Dr. Yifat Aran is a visiting scholar at the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, and an incoming Assistant Professor in Haifa University Faculty of Law.

href=\"http:\/\/apple.co\/found\">Found<\/a> features The SMART Tire Company co-founder and CEO Earl Cole, a one-time Survivor champion whose startup is working with NASA to commercialize some of its space-age tech. Cole won a NASA startup competition seeking entrepreneurs to work with its scientists and researchers on applications of innovations it created for space exploration that could work right here on Earth, helping people while also forming the basis for a commercially-viable business.<\/p>\n<p>For Cole, that resulted in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/16\/startup-founded-by-survivor-champ-debuts-airless-bike-tires-based-on-nasa-rover-tech\/\">The SMART Tire Company, a venture that&#8217;s using tech NASA developed to create more durable, puncture-proof tires to equip future rovers<\/a>. NASA turned to shape memory alloys (SMAs), which is a type of metal that can be flexed or bent, but that also has elastic properties to return to its original shape, to handle the unique task of building a tire that wouldn&#8217;t require inflation, but that would be able to handle rocky Martian terrain with aplomb. Cole&#8217;s startup is using the same technology to tackle the more than $100 billion tire industry \u2014 starting with bike tires, but eventually moving on to address other kinds of vehicles as well.<\/p>\n<p>We talked to Cole about the process of working with NASA, including its challenges and what the agency has to offer in terms of unique access to cutting-edge technology. He also shared his perspective on entrepreneurship from decades of experience, including difficulties with traditional VC and access to funding, and why he chose to initially raise money for his own startup through newly-available equity crowdsourcing. Cole also told us about why being a Survivor champ (and the first unanimous winner) provides crucial lessons for not only being a founder, but also running a company and being an effective leader, too.<\/p>\n<p>We had a great time chatting with Cole, and we hope you have just as much fun listening.

He is the co-founder and co-chair of <a href=\"https:\/\/onug.net\/\">ONUG<\/a>, which sponsors biannual meetings of nearly 1,000 IT business leaders of large enterprises.\t<\/div>\n\t\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><p id=\"speakable-summary\">Experts believe the data-lake market will hit a massive <a href=\"https:\/\/www.grandviewresearch.com\/industry-analysis\/data-lake-market\">$31.5 billion<\/a> in the next six years, a prediction that has led to much concern among large enterprises. Why? Well, an increase in data lakes equals an increase in public cloud consumption \u2014 which leads to a soaring amount of notifications, alerts and security events.<\/p>\n<p>Around 56% of enterprise organizations handle <a href=\"https:\/\/www.darkreading.com\/56--of-large-companies-handle-1000+-security-alerts-each-day\/d\/d-id\/1338318\">more than 1,000 security alerts<\/a> every day and 70% of IT professionals have seen the volume of alerts double in the past five years, according to a 2020 Dark Reading report that cited research by Sumo Logic. In fact, many in the ONUG community are on the order of 1 million events per second. Yes, per second, which is in the range of tens of peta events per year.<\/p>\n<p>Now that we are operating in a digitally transformed world, that number only continues to rise, leaving many enterprise IT leaders scrambling to handle these events and asking themselves if there\u2019s a better way.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tWhy isn\u2019t there a standardized approach for dealing with security of the public cloud \u2014 something so fundamental now to the operation of our society?\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>Compounding matters is the lack of a unified framework for dealing with public cloud security. End users and cloud consumers are forced to deal with increased spend on security infrastructure such as SIEMs, SOAR, security data lakes, tools, maintenance and staff \u2014 if they can find them \u2014 to operate with an \u201cadequate\u201d security posture.<\/p>\n<p>Public cloud isn\u2019t going away, and neither is the increase in data and security concerns. But enterprise leaders shouldn\u2019t have to continue scrambling to solve these problems. We live in a highly standardized world. Standard operating processes exist for the simplest of tasks, such as elementary school student drop-offs and checking out a company car. But why isn\u2019t there a standardized approach for dealing with security of the public cloud \u2014 something so fundamental now to the operation of our society?<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/onug.net\/\">ONUG<\/a> Collaborative had the same question. Security leaders from organizations such as FedEx, Raytheon Technologies, Fidelity, Cigna, Goldman Sachs and others came together to establish the Cloud Security Notification Framework. The goal is to create consistency in how cloud providers report security events, alerts and alarms, so end users receive improved visibility and governance of their data.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a closer look at the security challenges with public cloud and how CSNF aims to address the issues through a unified framework.<\/p>\n<h2>The root of the problem<\/h2>\n<p>A few key challenges are sparking the increased number of security alerts in the public cloud:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Rapid digital transformation sparked by COVID-19.<\/li>\n<li>An expanded network edge created by the modern, work-from-home environment.<\/li>\n<li>An increase in the type of security attacks.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The first two challenges go hand in hand. In March of last year, when companies were forced to shut down their offices and shift operations and employees to a remote environment, the wall between cyber threats and safety came crashing down. This wasn&#8217;t a huge issue for organizations already operating remotely, but for major enterprises the pain points quickly boiled to the surface.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"7GW42s23Sq\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/12\/is-there-still-room-in-the-cloud-security-market\/\">Is there still room in the cloud-security market?<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Is there still room in the cloud-security market?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/12\/is-there-still-room-in-the-cloud-security-market\/embed\/#?secret=7GW42s23Sq\" data-secret=\"7GW42s23Sq\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Numerous leaders have shared with me how security was outweighed by speed. Keeping everything up and running was prioritized over governance. Each employee effectively held a piece of the company\u2019s network edge in their home office. Without basic governance controls in place or training to teach employees how to spot phishing or other threats, the door was left wide open for attacks.<\/p>\n<p>In 2020, the FBI reported its cyber division was receiving nearly 4,000 complaints per day about security incidents, a <a href=\"https:\/\/searchsecurity.techtarget.com\/feature\/Enterprise-cybersecurity-threats-spiked-more-to-come\">400% increase from pre-pandemic<\/a> figures.<\/p>\n<p>Another security issue is the growing intelligence of cybercriminals. The Dark Reading report said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.darkreading.com\/56--of-large-companies-handle-1000+-security-alerts-each-day\/d\/d-id\/1338318\">67%<\/a> of IT leaders claim a core challenge is a constant change in the type of security threats that must be managed. Cybercriminals are smarter than ever. Phishing emails, entrance through IoT devices and various other avenues have been exploited to tap into an organization&#8217;s network. IT teams are constantly forced to adapt and spend valuable hours focused on deciphering what is a concern and what\u2019s not.<\/p>\n<p>Without a unified framework in place, the volume of incidents will spiral out of control.<\/p>\n<h2>Where CSNF comes into play<\/h2>\n<p>CSNF will prove beneficial for cloud providers and IT consumers alike. Security platforms often require integration timelines to wrap in all data from siloed sources, including asset inventory, vulnerability assessments, IDS products and past security notifications. These timelines can be expensive and inefficient.<\/p>\n<p>But with a standardized framework like CSNF, the integration process for past notifications is pared down and contextual processes are improved for the entire ecosystem, efficiently reducing spend and saving SecOps and DevSecOps teams time to focus on more strategic tasks like security posture assessment, developing new products and improving existing solutions.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a closer look at the benefits a standardized approach can create for all parties:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>End users<\/strong>: CSNF can streamline operations for enterprise cloud consumers, like IT teams, and allows improved visibility and greater control over the security posture of their data. This enhanced sense of protection from improved cloud governance benefits all individuals.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cloud providers<\/strong>: CSNF can eliminate the barrier to entry currently prohibiting an enterprise consumer from using additional services from a specific cloud provider by freeing up added security resources. Also, improved end-user cloud governance encourages more cloud consumption from businesses, increasing provider revenue and providing confidence that their data will be secure.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cloud vendors<\/strong>: Cloud vendors that provide SaaS solutions are spending more on engineering resources to deal with increased security notifications. But with a standardized framework in place, these additional resources would no longer be necessary. Instead of spending money on such specific needs along with labor, vendors could refocus core staff on improving operations and products such as user dashboards and applications.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Working together, all groups can effectively reduce friction from security alerts and create a controlled cloud environment for years to come.<\/p>\n<h2>What\u2019s next?<\/h2>\n<p>CSNF is in the building phase. Cloud consumers have banded together to compile requirements, and consumers continue to provide guidance as a prototype is established. The cloud providers are now in the process of building the key component of CSNF, its Decorator, which provides an open-source multicloud security reporting translation service.<\/p>\n<p>The pandemic created many changes in our world, including new security challenges in the public cloud. Reducing IT noise must be a priority to continue operating with solid governance and efficiency, as it enhances a sense of security, eliminates the need for increased resources and allows for more cloud consumption. ONUG is working to ensure that the industry stays a step ahead of security events in an era of rapid digital transformation.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"1V0ywXAXU0\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/01\/bring-cisos-into-the-c-suite-to-bake-cybersecurity-into-company-culture\/\">Bring CISOs into the C-suite to bake cybersecurity into company culture<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Bring CISOs into the C-suite to bake cybersecurity into company culture&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/01\/bring-cisos-into-the-c-suite-to-bake-cybersecurity-into-company-culture\/embed\/#?secret=1V0ywXAXU0\" data-secret=\"1V0ywXAXU0\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Standard operating processes exist for the simplest of tasks, so why isn\u2019t there a standardized approach for dealing with security of the public cloud \u2014 something fundamental to our society?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":133574447,"featured_media":1223273,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"carmot_uuid":"f1c93a4c-040b-3ff3-b0bf-6277fab08cab"},"categories":[24405894,25515,352,21587494,17396],"tags":[1715866,576666023,5767724,5654811,449557039,8159,965824,449557088,801],"crunchbase_tag":[576794806],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/identity-security.png","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/2QtsCGb","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"premiumContent":false,"premiumCutoffPercent":1,"featured":false,"subtitle":"","seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","tc_cb_mapping":[{"slug":"opinion","cb_name":"Opinion","cb_slug":"opinion-a9b9-organization","cb_link":"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/opinion-a9b9"}],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[2141119],"hide_featured_image":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2141114"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2141114"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2141114\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2143307,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2141114\/revisions\/2143307"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/nick-lippis"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2141114&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/133574447"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1223273"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2141114"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2141114"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2141114"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2141114"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2141114"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2141114"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2141114"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":2141119,"name":"Nick Lippis","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/nick-lippis\/","description":"Nick Lippis is an authority on advanced IP networks and their benefits to business objectives.

And, they argued, these IAP &#8220;taxes&#8221; have to be passed along to the consumer, leading to higher prices. In Spotify&#8217;s case, this puts them at a disadvantage when having to compete against a direct rival, like Apple Music, which doesn&#8217;t have the same impediment.<\/p>\n<p>The companies also argued how little power they had to fight against any changes enacted by the platform makers. <strong>Tile&#8217;s General Counsel Kirsten Daru noted that her company&#8217;s relationship with Apple used to be symbiotic<\/strong>, saying Apple &#8220;sold our devices in their retail stores, and they even featured us on stage at their Worldwide Developer conference in 2018. But that all changed when Apple decided that it wanted to take over this category,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If Apple turned on us, it can turn on anyone.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ujhPtdvM2t\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/21\/senate-antitrust-hearing-apple-tile-spotify-match-epic\/\">Senate antitrust hearing on app stores gives Apple critics a big soapbox<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Senate antitrust hearing on app stores gives Apple critics a big soapbox&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/21\/senate-antitrust-hearing-apple-tile-spotify-match-epic\/embed\/#?secret=ujhPtdvM2t\" data-secret=\"ujhPtdvM2t\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><strong>Spotify spoke of the times Apple threatened to pull it from the App Store over rule violations<\/strong>. And how Apple told Spotify it couldn&#8217;t email customers to tell them how they could upgrade via its website instead of through IAP. Apple, meanwhile, defended its position equating it to coming in a Verizon store to advertise that the new iPhone was available for sale down the street at an Apple Store. &#8220;No retailer is going to allow us to do that,&#8221; Apple&#8217;s Chief Compliance Officer Kyle Andeer argued.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Match talked about app rejections and Apple dictating how it can run its business<\/strong>. It said it wanted to verify IDs for a dating app in Taiwan and Apple wouldn&#8217;t allow this. Match also mentioned an app rejection that kept it from releasing its LGBTGQ+ safety update for two months. (But we&#8217;ve learned that Apple&#8217;s rejection was not related to the LGBTQ+ feature itself.)<\/p>\n<p>Match Chief Legal Officer &amp; Secretary Jared Sine also threw out a pretty big bomb when it alerted lawmakers to the fact that they received a call the night before their testimony. <strong>Google wanted to know why Match&#8217;s testimony appeared to differ from what it said during earnings,<\/strong> he said. (On the earnings call, Match said they believed they could work through the issues of Google&#8217;s 30% tax.) Google&#8217;s Senior Director Public Policy &amp; Government Relations Wilson White said &#8220;it sounds as if some business development folks who are working on commercial conversations&#8221; called Match and that Google doesn&#8217;t &#8220;view that as a threat&#8230;we would never threaten our partners.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3>Tile argues for a level playing field<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Immediately after <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/20\/apple-officially-unveils-its-lost-item-finder-airtag\/\">launching its lost item finder AirTag<\/a>, Apple had to defend its product against antitrust claims made by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thetileapp.com\/\">Tile<\/a>.<\/strong> From what we&#8217;ve seen, there are mixed feelings out there as to whether Tile has a case. Tile carved out a market for lost item finders and has many years&#8217; worth of a head start on Apple. Some say it wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about Apple if it had continued to innovate. After all, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thetileapp.com\/en-us\/products?utm_campaign=382442024&amp;utm_source=bing&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=tile%20app-e&amp;adgroup=1222657374215262&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;msclkid=32b3b356b0a212a79d92d3d5b82009f6\">just look at the AirTag hardware design<\/a> and the clever way it guides you to a lost item with directional arrows.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"zrYDUdLxqx\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/20\/tile-bashes-apples-new-airtag-as-unfair-competition\/\">Tile bashes Apple&#8217;s new AirTag as unfair competition<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Tile bashes Apple&#8217;s new AirTag as unfair competition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/20\/tile-bashes-apples-new-airtag-as-unfair-competition\/embed\/#?secret=zrYDUdLxqx\" data-secret=\"zrYDUdLxqx\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>But Tile points out there were areas where it believes <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/20\/tile-bashes-apples-new-airtag-as-unfair-competition\/\">Apple didn&#8217;t level the playing field<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Tile has asked since 2019 for access to the U1 chip for UWB (ultra wideband) access, like AirTag has, so it can roll out its own UWB device. But Apple only this month, April 2021, announced a draft specification for chipset manufacturers that will arrive later this spring (AFTER AirTag debuts) which will allow third-party device makers to take advantage of ultra wideband technology in U1-equipped Apple devices.<\/p>\n<p>And while Apple opened up Find My to third-parties &#8212; a move it&#8217;s using to fend of antitrust claims &#8212; that means Tile wouldn&#8217;t be able to continue its direct relationship with its customers through its own iOS app, if it made the switch. As to what other details that Find My agreement forces upon developers, Tile couldn&#8217;t say. When pressed by lawmakers in the antitrust hearing this week, Tile&#8217;s Daru said she couldn&#8217;t talk about it, because Apple makes companies sign an NDA. Apple CCO Andeer declined to allow Daru to answer questions about the nature of the agreement for the purpose of the hearing either.<\/p>\n<p>Tile had several other grievances as well, like how its app had to ask permission to do things like track location or run in the background or use Bluetooth, when Apple&#8217;s Find My did not.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>They took away one of our critical permissions, which requires our customers to go deep, deep, deep into their settings to turn Tile on. Find my, by contrast, is on by default&#8230;when you set up your operating system. And in order to turn it off you have to go deep into your Settings and actually enter a password. Apple also started serving prompts with that same update to our users &#8212; once they figured out how to turn Tile on, they started serving these prompts encouraging them to turn Tile off. But they didn&#8217;t serve up those prompts for Find My. Our Bluetooth network &#8212; of course, people need to opt in to the Bluetooth network; I think that&#8217;s great. We are complete supporters of consumer transparency. But the Find my Bluetooth network in the new Find My app is on by default. And then with these AirTags, as I discussed, we have the UWB issue, which I won&#8217;t repeat. But there&#8217;s something else. It&#8217;s called..they call the &#8216;magic onboarding flow.&#8217; To connect your AirPods or your AirTags with your phone, you don&#8217;t even have to open the Find My app. You just put them near. But that magic flow isn&#8217;t available to third-parties like Tile.<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>Apple questioned about the problem with App Store subscription scams<\/h3>\n<p>During the hearing, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/22\/apple-downplays-complaints-about-app-store-scams-in-antitrust-hearing\/\">Apple was also specifically pressed on its failure to police app store scams<\/a>. The tech giant has argued that one of the reasons it requires developers to pay App Store commissions is to help Apple fight marketplace fraud and protect consumers. But developers claim Apple is doing very little to stop obvious scams that are now raking in millions and impacting consumer trust in the overall subscription economy, as well as in their own legitimate, subscription-based businesses.<\/p>\n<p>One developer in particular, Kosta Eleftheriou, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/03\/apple-urged-to-root-out-rating-scams-as-developer-highlights-ugly-cost-of-enforcement-failure\/\">has made it his mission<\/a> to highlight some of the most egregious scams on the App Store. Functioning as a one-man bunco squad, Eleftheriou regularly tweets out examples of apps that are leveraging fake reviews to promote their harmful businesses. Georgia&#8217;s Senator Ossoff asked why we had to rely on independent reports (presumably referring to these efforts by Kosta) to route out scams? Apple defended itself by saying security was a cat-and-mouse game and consumers were refunded when scammed.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"7jNGEGRaYW\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/22\/apple-downplays-complaints-about-app-store-scams-in-antitrust-hearing\/\">Apple downplays complaints about App Store scams in antitrust hearing<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Apple downplays complaints about App Store scams in antitrust hearing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/22\/apple-downplays-complaints-about-app-store-scams-in-antitrust-hearing\/embed\/#?secret=7jNGEGRaYW\" data-secret=\"7jNGEGRaYW\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h3>Apple and Google questioned on use of app store data<\/h3>\n<p>Finally, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/21\/apple-and-google-pressed-in-antitrust-hearing-on-whether-app-stores-share-data-with-product-development-teams\/\">an interesting line of questioning<\/a> put to Apple and Google asked the companies if they had an internal firewall between sharing data gleaned from their app stores with their own product development teams working on other initiatives. Apple&#8217;s answer left room for doubt. Andeer initially responded that Apple has separate teams, which was clearly not what Senator Blumenthal wanted to know.

Like some business card apps in the past, you can flip between a personal profile and a business profile in Popl in order to share the appropriate information when out networking.<\/p>\n<h3>Yak Tack<\/h3>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2143299\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2143299\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2143299\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-4.29.28-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-4.29.28-PM.jpg 3296w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-4.29.28-PM.jpg?resize=150,77 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-4.29.28-PM.jpg?resize=300,154 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-4.29.28-PM.jpg?resize=768,395 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-4.29.28-PM.jpg?resize=680,350 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-4.29.28-PM.jpg?resize=1536,790 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-4.29.28-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1054 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-4.29.28-PM.jpg?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2143299\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> YakTack<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Wordsmiths will like <a href=\"https:\/\/yaktack.com\/\">Yak Tack&#8217;s<\/a> simple app, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/15\/yak-tack-is-a-super-simple-app-to-boost-vocabulary\/\">reviewed here by TechCrunch<\/a>, that help users remember new words using a system it calls &#8220;tacking.&#8221; When you find a word you want to remember, you use the app to look it up then &#8220;tack&#8221; it to start the system of repetition that helps combat forgetting.

href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Troubles\">the Troubles<\/a>. The city has undergone infrastructure improvements over the past two decades, tourism has boomed thanks to attractions such as the shipyard where the RMS Titanic was built and Game of Thrones shooting locations, and employment has risen steadily in the city since 2016, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nisra.gov.uk\/statistics\/annual-employee-jobs-surveys\/business-register-and-employment-survey\">Northen Ireland&#8217;s Department for the Economy<\/a>. The city also has the famed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.qub.ac.uk\/\">Queen\u2019s University<\/a> and low living costs to count in its favor, and gentrification is starting to take place, which shows things are looking up for Northern Ireland&#8217;s capital.<\/p>\n<p>And as far as the local startup scene goes, the U.K.&#8217;s Tech Nation <a href=\"https:\/\/technation.io\/insights\/report-2018\/belfast\/\">found<\/a> in 2018 that about 26% of Belfast\u2019s workforce was employed in tech, and it is among cities in the country with the <a href=\"https:\/\/technation.io\/scale-ratio\/investment-balance\/\">highest growth potential<\/a> for 2021.<\/p>\n<p>With that in mind, we reached out to founders, investors and executives in the city to get an inside look at the state of the current tech startup ecosystem. According to the survey, the city is strong in sectors such as fintech, agritech, hospitality tech, emerging tech, cybersecurity, SaaS and medtech. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.igniteni.com\/\">Ignite NI<\/a> emerged as an important native incubator and accelerator.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Interesting startups that our respondents mentioned include: CropSafe, SideQuest, Aflo, Material Evolution, Cloudsmith, LegitFit, Continually, Gratsi, 54 North Design, Animal Manager, Kairos Sports Tech, Budibase, Incisiv, Automated Intelligence, loyalBe, Konvi, Lane 44, Teamfeepay.com, Axial3D, Neurovalens, Payhere, and Civic Dollars.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Use discount code <strong>BELFAST<\/strong> to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/subscribe\/\">save 25% off an annual or two-year Extra Crunch membership.<\/a><br \/>\nThis offer is only available to readers in the U.K. and Europe, and expires on May 31, 2021.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>The tech investment scene was characterized as being strong in software and life sciences, but sometimes too conservative or risk-averse. However, this seems to be changing for the better, and foreign direct investment (FDI) is an important growth factor for the ecosystem.<\/p>\n<p>Although there remains uncertainty around how Brexit will affect Northern Ireland, one executive said, \u201cIf we play our cards right, we can capitalize on it. Being positioned both in the EU and U.K. markets gives us advantages that we would be foolish to waste.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>One of the founders foresees more private capital flowing into Belfast as global investors realize that &#8220;the combination of great local universities and very strong FDI has attracted some brilliant engineers.&#8221; The low cost of living is also encouraging for talent to stay put in the city, which makes for a tech scene that&#8217;s poised to take off, this founder added.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s who we spoke to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/cormacq\/\">Cormac Quinn<\/a>, founder &amp; CEO, <a href=\"https:\/\/loyalbe.io\/\">loyalBe<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/susan-kelly-3070557\/\">Susan Kelly<\/a>, CEO, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.afloanalytics.com\">Respiratory Analytics<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/ryantcrown.com\/\">Ryan Crown<\/a>, co-founder, <a href=\"https:\/\/hillstreethatch.com\/\">Hill Street Hatch<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/fearghalcampbell\/\">Fearghal Campbell<\/a>, founder, <a href=\"https:\/\/pitchbooking.com\">Pitchbooking<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/jack-spargo\/\">Jack Spargo<\/a>, co-founder &amp; CEO, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gratsi.io\">Gratsi<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/brendan-digney\/\">Brendan Digney<\/a>, founder, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.machine-eye.com\">Machine Eye Technology<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/toyah-warnock\">Toyah Warnock<\/a>, co-founder, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lane44.com\">Lane 44<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/alancarson\/\">Alan Carson<\/a>, CEO, <a href=\"https:\/\/cloudsmith.com\">Cloudsmith<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Cormac Quinn, founder &amp; CEO, loyalBe<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in?

I always anticipated having to leave Belfast for the U.S. to be able to start a tech company, but I&#8217;m glad this is no longer a requirement or even the standard any more.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in your city?<\/strong><br \/>\nThere are a few that stand out: Cloudsmith (devtools), LegitFit (scheduling), Continually (chatbots\/marketing), and Automated Intelligence (data management). This is certainly not an exhaustive list of interesting startups, just a few that come to mind.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Belfast? What\u2019s their focus?<\/strong><br \/>\nInvestors here can be somewhat conservative and slightly traditional. If you&#8217;re raising investment north of \u00a31 million, you would likely need to look outside the jurisdiction. There also just isn&#8217;t enough private capital at the moment, which is a shame, as Belfast has some fantastic talent combined with a very low cost of living, which means investor money tends to go further (no crazy rents, reasonable salaries, etc.). It feels we&#8217;re at the beginning of a cycle in Belfast, however \u2014 I expect to see many more local exits over the coming years, which will likely lead to new private capital inflows.<\/p>\n<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Belfast? Will they move out? Will others move in?<\/strong><br \/>\nI understand the city was growing pre-pandemic, and I believe this trend will continue once life returns to a semi-normal state. For a long time, Belfast was a city people didn&#8217;t want to live in due to historical issues, but that has been slowly changing. New developments are popping up all over the city, from student accommodation to hotels and nice apartments. 15-20 years ago, Belfast had hardly any of this.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in your city (e.g. Investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?<\/strong><br \/>\nChris McClelland, MD of Ignite NI: He&#8217;s a mentor on the city&#8217;s top accelerator program. Co-founded BrewBot.<br \/>\nIan Browne, COO of Ignite NI: Entrepreneur and another mentor to startups in the city.<br \/>\nMark Dowds: Venture partner at Anthemis, co-founder at Ormeau Baths (in my opinion it&#8217;s the city&#8217;s best co-working space).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where do you see your city\u2019s tech scene in five years?<\/strong><br \/>\nWe&#8217;re in uncertain times due to Brexit, but I think if we play our cards right, we can capitalize on it. Being positioned both in the EU and U.K. markets gives us advantages that we would be foolish to waste. I do think we will see more private capital flowing into Belfast as global investors realize that the combination of great local universities and very strong FDI has attracted some brilliant engineers. Combine that with the fact that cost of living remains quite low, which means their capital can go much further (rather than going to landlords) and you have a tech scene that&#8217;s poised for take-off.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Can you recommend any companies that should appear in our global Startup Battlefield competition?<\/strong><br \/>\nCloudsmith.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"OvXJxoRdl3\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/13\/9-investors-discuss-challenges-opportunities-and-the-impact-of-cloud-vendors-in-enterprise-data-lakes\/\">9 investors discuss hurdles, opportunities and the impact of cloud vendors in enterprise data lakes<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;9 investors discuss hurdles, opportunities and the impact of cloud vendors in enterprise data lakes&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/13\/9-investors-discuss-challenges-opportunities-and-the-impact-of-cloud-vendors-in-enterprise-data-lakes\/embed\/#?secret=OvXJxoRdl3\" data-secret=\"OvXJxoRdl3\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h2>Susan Kelly, CEO, Respiratory Analytics<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in?

Later-stage companies like medtech mainstays Axial3D and Neurovalens are doing great things too!<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Belfast? What\u2019s their focus?<\/strong><br \/>\nWe have a mix of angel and institutional investors in Belfast. Hard to say a specific focus on a particular industry, but there are a couple of sectors that are strong in the city given the focus of the local universities. Medtech and cybersecurity both feature heavily in the startup scene.<\/p>\n<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Belfast? Will they move out? Will others move in?<\/strong><br \/>\nBelfast benefits from a relatively low cost of living in relation to the rest of the U.K., meaning that we are seeing an increase in startups moving here from other major cities. The support for early-stage startups has also contributed to this influx. As a city, we are well set up for moving to a hybrid way of working. You can traverse across the center of the city in 15 mins on foot, which means popping into a city center office isn&#8217;t a big undertaking.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in your city (e.g. Investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?<\/strong><br \/>\nInvest NI &#8211; Government support agency.<br \/>\nIgnite NI &#8211; Seed-stage accelerator program.<br \/>\nUlsterBank Accelerator &#8211; Early-stage accelerator program.<br \/>\nAurient Investments &#8211; Angel investment group with a diverse investment portfolio.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where do you see your city\u2019s tech scene in five years?<\/strong><br \/>\nI believe we will see the strongest seed-stage companies from 2017-2020 becoming established companies within our tech scene to match the influx of FDI companies from further afield.<\/p>\n<h2>Jack Spargo, co-founder &amp; CEO, Gratsi<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in?

the industry.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI remember a very prominent investor saying at the time, \u2018All these new angel investors, they&#8217;re all going to lose all their money; they&#8217;re fools for

He shared why he thinks the biggest returns in the coming years will flow to very small funds that feature a big financial commitment from the general partners. He talked about investing in other small funds to ensure strong deal flow. He also shared why three months ago he moved to Miami, where he believes a &#8220;movement&#8221; is afoot.

It&#8217;s interesting that you stayed for just four years, leaving in 2012 when the company went public.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>BG: I had given some thought to staying longer, and obviously many of my friends are still there and have risen in the ranks and done extremely well. I was just very eager to get started as an investor . . . and at the time, Facebook was saying, &#8216;Well, you can&#8217;t stay here and do angel investing.&#8217; Little did I know that some people skirted the rules a bit and ended up angel investing [without leaving]. But I was very excited to dig in and quite glad that I got started when I did [because] my second-ever angel investment was in Coinbase and had I stayed longer, maybe I would have missed that one.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;ve mentioned in the past that you&#8217;d been a Bitcoin nerd and followed some of the discussion threads that others might have missed. What sparked that early interest?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>BG: There&#8217;s that famous William Gibson <a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/quotes\/681-the-future-is-already-here-it-s-just-not-evenly\">quote<\/a>: &#8220;The future is already here &#8212; it&#8217;s just not evenly distributed.&#8221; I think about that in quite literal terms in the sense that there are sort of pockets of the future, these bubble hiding all around. In 2012, I think the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Bitcoin\/\">Bitcoin subreddit<\/a> was this bubble where, within it, people were talking very excitedly about Bitcoin and if you weren&#8217;t in it, you would kind of scratch your head about it.\u00a0 . . . I felt a similar feeling about Facebook back in the day. I was a college student when Facebook launched, and everyone who was in college at the time was kind of privy to this future that was quite obvious amongst college students. But if you weren&#8217;t in college, people would kind of scratch their heads and say, &#8216;I don&#8217;t really understand what&#8217;s going on.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: Can you comment on your return from Coinbase? You were an investor in the A, C and E rounds. Is there anything you can say about the cash on cash return?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>BG: A lot of this is fairly <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/rsg\/status\/1354827309421883393\">public knowledge<\/a> at this point, but the Series A cost basis was 20 cents, so folks can kind of do math based on that.<\/p>\n<p>I think so much of startup investing is [that] you can kind of have a prepared mind about things, but there&#8217;s also an element of luck about it. I don&#8217;t think I had complete foresight when I made the investment that Coinbase was going to be an $80 billion-plus company. I thought it was going to be successful. But it has clearly eclipsed even my greatest expectations, and I feel very lucky and fortunate to have to realized that.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: There are various on-ramps to VC these days, including AngelList syndicates and rolling funds. Did you ever take advantage of these or did you keep writing checks from your own pocket before founding Form Capital?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>BG: I don&#8217;t know if I should should be embarrassed to say this or not, but when I first got my start as an angel, I got advice from financial advisors and who said, &#8216;When it comes to angel investing, only invest a tiny percentage of your overall net worth into this.&#8217; And to be honest, I maybe foolishly ignored that advice. Obviously, it has netted out in the long term, [but] it was large risk I took. I did 40 deals out of my own pocket. I was sort of getting closer to the end of running out of tape.<\/p>\n<p>[At that point] I wound up investing through a small scout-like fund for a few deals and hit some incredible deals through that [and] I was able to play around, investing at a larger check size. It also helped me sort of step-stone up to doing [Form Capital]. But yeah, I kind of ignored a lot of the advice and put a lot of my own personal net worth into seed-stage investing and thankfully, it all worked out. Otherwise, I could have been in trouble. I think the advice is well-considered.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: How might you advise someone just spinning out of, say, Coinbase and thinking about jumping into angel investing? Go it alone? Use one of these other products?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>BG: I think it depends on their risk profile and their own appetite and whether they truly enjoy this type of work, because it can become a lot of work. If you want to develop a real portfolio, you have to take a lot of meetings, you have to make yourself available and put yourself out there in a way that I think a lot of folks who wind up getting a very meaningful personal exit may not want. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those folks who are trying to break into venture who haven&#8217;t had this sort of exit, I say go for it. I say welcome. Let&#8217;s go invest together. Honestly, there&#8217;s a lot of space for small check investors. I think the folks writing small collaborative checks have an incredible opportunity to post some insane multiples.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: You stress collaboration. Are people more or less collaborative when you started in 2012? Seed-size checks are <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/24\/us-seed-stage-investing-flourished-during-pandemic\/\">getting bigger<\/a>, which suggests things have grown more competitive.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>BG: There was a period where it was extremely competitive, and for some folks who are deploying out of a certain fund size, it might feel extremely competitive right now. To me, it feels at its most collaborative, including because I am personally an LP in a number of tiny funds [headed by] tremendously talented managers who are just getting their start . . .<\/p>\n<p>I do think there are a number of funds that raised more than they should have; I think there&#8217;s a danger zone somewhere around $80 million where you&#8217;re forced to be a lead investor and you can&#8217;t be a collaborative investor and so it becomes this slug-it-out, duke-it-out [situation] with other other funds as to who&#8217;s going to be the lead writer on a given deal . . .<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"30qaNv0rRx\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/24\/us-seed-stage-investing-flourished-during-pandemic\/\">US seed-stage investing flourished during pandemic<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;US seed-stage investing flourished during pandemic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/24\/us-seed-stage-investing-flourished-during-pandemic\/embed\/#?secret=30qaNv0rRx\" data-secret=\"30qaNv0rRx\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>If you&#8217;re aiming to write a large check, let&#8217;s say $1.5 million, and the founder comes back to you and says, &#8216;We can&#8217;t do that, but we can give you a $150,000 allocation,&#8217; that&#8217;s just absolutely fatal to somebody trying to deploy a very large seed fund, versus if my target check size is something like $250,000. If I get squeezed down to $150,000, I can actually make that work economically within the fund math.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: So you&#8217;ll write a check as small as $150,000. What&#8217;s the upper boundary, and how much ownership are you targeting when you fund a startup?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>BG: It&#8217;s upwards of $500,000, give or take, and our target is 3%. But, again, part of the joy of being a small fund manager is more flexibility in terms of constructing a portfolio. In the cases where we may get squeezed down a little bit, or we want to invest at a slightly higher valuation than is typical, we can paint outside the lines a tiny bit more.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: Meaning bigger checks? Do you typically raise special purpose vehicles, or SPVS, in order to take a bigger bite of certain companies?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>BG: One pattern for that was my personal investment in Coinbase. By being close to the company, by helping on a few very minor things over the years in terms of design, in terms of making connections to design firms and helping recruit some designers, they gave me follow-on allocations. And then in the Series E, I was able to raise an SPV into the deal based on the idea of building a deep relationship with the company.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s essentially the model going forward. We may or may not continue to pursue SPVs. We may pick a different vehicle in the future for how to deploy that follow-on capital. But the idea is: wedge in early with a small check, put a lot of skin in the game on that check [with a bigger general partner commitment in the fund than is typical], and build a relationship and try to be disproportionately helpful relative to our check size.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: You tweeted that for that SPV, you pitched 50 different parties, and only three said yes.<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">I invested a total of 3 times into Coinbase, including an SPV I raised into the last round.<\/p>\n<p>I pitched the SPV to almost 50 different parties.

I wasn&#8217;t the only person who had one, and so there was some amount of market competition. Then just the nature of SPVs is such that you get your allocation, and bang goes the starting gun, and you need to very quickly talk to a lot of people.<\/p>\n<p>[Still] it is remarkable how quickly the perception of that company has changed over just two short years, give or take. I give a lot of credit to the investors who backed us on that SPV because they they took the risk with us. I&#8217;ve had a number of people [since] say, &#8216;Oh, you should have called me, I would have invested.&#8217; And maybe they would, maybe they wouldn&#8217;t have.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: You talked at the outset about communities and bubbles and I can&#8217;t help but wonder if you think you are hearing about more interesting deals, having moved recently to Miami three months ago, than you would in the Bay Area.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>BG: It does really feel like that&#8217;s the case, and I started seeing this maybe in late November, and then very quickly said, &#8216;Okay, why not? This feels fun, this feels exciting.&#8217; And I&#8217;m glad I made the jump, because while I love San Francisco &#8212; I think San Francisco is a tremendous place [that] will always be one of the great tech epicenters of the world &#8212; I think a lot of folks moved here because they were looking to change things up. And the energy that comes from that, where everyone&#8217;s trying to make this work, is really quite exciting.<\/p>\n<p>A lot of people said, &#8216;Oh, you&#8217;re going to miss out on things by moving to Miami, you&#8217;re going to take a step back in your career.&#8217; And really, it&#8217;s been the opposite of that. It&#8217;s been a total accelerant of my career and investing.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re an interesting fit for Miami because Miami is known as being a design capital, and we&#8217;re a really design-driven fund, and there&#8217;s a lot of parallels there. [But I also realized that] I can be one of many thousands of new funds based in the Bay Area, or I can be one of a tiny handful based here in Miami and get all these tailwinds and have the mayor hype us up, and that sounds like a good deal to me.<\/p>\n<p><em>Pictured above, left to right: Goodlatte with Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam, who more recently co-founded the cryptocurrency investment firm Paradigm.<br \/>\n<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Bobby Goodlatte has only been an investor for about a decade, but he appears to have already made tens of millions of dollars, contrary to the expectations of some traditional VCs who have privately, and publicly, griped that too many novice investors have flooded into the industry. \u201cI remember a very prominent investor saying at [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":89646803,"featured_media":2143335,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"carmot_uuid":"9fe4e604-1458-3cc0-b146-49aa3c60070b"},"categories":[17396,35394854],"tags":[155790649,98743001,81819,576876628,17907227,1937788],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-23-at-2.29.03-PM.png","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/32L9rtU","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"premiumContent":false,"premiumCutoffPercent":1,"featured":false,"subtitle":"","seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[89646803],"hide_featured_image":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2143297"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2143297"}],"version-history":[{"count":18,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2143297\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2143399,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2143297\/revisions\/2143399"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/89646803"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2143297&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/89646803"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2143335"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2143297"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2143297"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2143297"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2143297"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2143297"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2143297"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2143297"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":89646803,"name":"Connie Loizos","url":"","description":"","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/connie-loizos\/","slug":"connie-loizos","avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/52bc07c5a4dde8dabe873328ca360e36?s=24&d=identicon&r=g","48":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/52bc07c5a4dde8dabe873328ca360e36?s=48&d=identicon&r=g","96":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/52bc07c5a4dde8dabe873328ca360e36?s=96&d=identicon&r=g"},"links":{"homepage":"http:\/\/www.strictlyvc.com\/","twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cookie","linkedin":"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pub\/connie-loizos\/0\/282\/380","facebook":"","crunchbase":"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/connie-loizos"},"position":"Silicon Valley Editor","cbDescription":"<p>Loizos has been reporting on Silicon Valley since the late \\'90s, when she joined the original Red Herring magazine.

A <a href=\"https:\/\/d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net\/CIK-0001564408\/9f8cb681-bb0d-474b-801f-4e85df9906eb.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">10-Q filing<\/a> from Snap today has now put a price tag on that deal.<\/p>\n<p>Snap paid a total of $124.4 million, covering technology, IP, customer relationships and payouts to the team. The filing also noted that Snap spent a total of $204.5 million on acquisitions in 2020, but did not break them out.<\/p>\n<p>The news comes ahead of Snap &#8212; whose flagship app Snapchat now has 280 million daily active users &#8212; preparing for its Snap Partner Conference in May.

Currently it&#8217;s advertising for a variety of engineering, marketing and product roles in commerce, to, in the words of one of the listings, for a <a href=\"https:\/\/wd1.myworkdaysite.com\/recruiting\/snapchat\/snap\/job\/Los-Angeles-California\/Product-Manager--Commerce_R0018013\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Product Manager<\/a>, &#8220;develop and launch shopping experiences and services that make shopping fun for Snapchatters and drive results for brands.&#8221; The listings also include a role specifically to work on Snapchat-based e-commerce efforts for direct-to-consumer (D2C) businesses.<\/p>\n<p>And it has been making other recent acquisitions in addition to Fit Analytics that also line up with that.<\/p>\n<p>They have included <a href=\"https:\/\/screenshopit.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Screenshop<\/a>, an app that describes itself as &#8220;the first AI-back style lens,&#8221; which can identify shoppable items in photos and then build a custom catalog of similar products that you can buy (akin to &#8220;shop the look&#8221; features that you will have come across in fashion media). And it&#8217;s also acquired Ariel AI, which has built technology to quickly render people in 3D, technology that can be used in a diverse set of applications, from games to virtual try-ons of clothing, makeup or accessories.<\/p>\n<p>Snap confirmed the Ariel acquisition to CNBC in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/01\/26\/snap-acquires-ariel-ai-to-boost-snapchat-augmented-reality-features.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">January<\/a>. And while Screenshop deal was first reported earlier this month by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theinformation.com\/articles\/snap-acquires-screenshop-app-to-fuel-shopping-push\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Information<\/a>, Snap has declined to comment on it, although we have found people who worked at the startup now working at Snap.<\/p>\n<p>Both acquisitions closed in 2020, according to reports, meaning that they came out of that year&#8217;s $204.5 million acquisition run. (Snap also noted a smaller acquisition, for $7.6 million, in the most recent quarter, but it did not disclose any further details.)<\/p>\n<p>Even before all this, Snap had been making smaller efforts and tests in commerce going back years, although none of them have tipped into mainstream efforts.<\/p>\n<p>Among them, in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/02\/01\/snapchat-snap-store\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2018<\/a> it launched a <a href=\"https:\/\/store.snapchat.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Snap Store<\/a> &#8212; but that so far has not progressed beyond selling merchandise based on Bitmoji characters. And work on a Gucci shoe campaign last year, where Snapchat users could try shoes on in AR and then buy them, was seen by some as its\u00a0big step into commerce &#8212; &#8220;we&#8217;ve moved from pure entertainment and expanded the use-case. And so with brands, it&#8217;s a really exciting time, especially in fashion and beauty. The Snapchat camera is connecting brands to their audiences in new ways,&#8221; a Snapchat AR executive said at the time &#8212; but that also didn&#8217;t develop into much beyond a one-off effort.<\/p>\n<p>But with the pandemic leading to a surge of shopping online, and technology continuing to improve, the iron may finally be hot here.<\/p>\n<p>As we said around the Fit Analytics acquisition, the idea of diversifying Snapchat&#8217;s revenue streams by building in more commerce experiences makes a lot of sense.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ekPoDIGft1\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/26\/9-vcs-say-interactivity-regulation-and-independent-creators-will-reshape-digital-media-in-2021\/\">10 VCs say interactivity, regulation and independent creators will reshape digital media in 2021<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;10 VCs say interactivity, regulation and independent creators will reshape digital media in 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/26\/9-vcs-say-interactivity-regulation-and-independent-creators-will-reshape-digital-media-in-2021\/embed\/#?secret=ekPoDIGft1\" data-secret=\"ekPoDIGft1\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>It gives the company another revenue stream at a time when Apple is <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/19FXV09gwE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">introducing changes<\/a> that might well affect how advertising can run and be monetized in the future.

evaluating new investment opportunities, as well as supporting the growth and strategy of current portfolio companies.\t<\/div>\n\t\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">This past year<\/span> has brought many new developments to a historically traditional process: taking a company public. Many of the standard levers in an initial public offering (IPO) are being redefined as we write.<\/p>\n<p>The emergence of direct listings is just one example. Even in more traditional IPOs, we have seen unique lock-up provisions, different auction approaches, virtual and rapid roadshows become the norm, and company-centric approaches to investor allocations.<\/p>\n<p>But clearly the most disruptive trend of the past 12 months has been the predominance of the special purpose acquisition company, commonly known as a SPAC. A SPAC is a company with no commercial operations that is formed strictly to raise capital through an IPO for the purpose of acquiring an existing, private company.<\/p>\n<p>Also known as &#8220;blank check companies,\u201d these entities typically have 24 months to find a company to buy or merge with.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tThe fundamental thing to remember about the SPAC process is that the result is a publicly traded company open to the regulatory environment of the SEC and the scrutiny of public shareholders.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>That process essentially makes the acquired company a publicly traded one. SPACs can, and generally do, raise additional capital in the form of a PIPE (private investment in public equity) in order to reaffirm the SPAC valuation and raise additional capital with the identified target company.<\/p>\n<p>SPACs have been around for decades, but they took the 2020 IPO market by storm. For some context: 2020 had more than 248 SPACs \u2014 more than the sum of the SPACs in the previous decade. While SPACs and the general sentiment around them continue to evolve, 2021 started off strong with 298 newly formed blank-check companies to date that have raised a collective $95 billion (versus $83 billion in 2020). It\u2019s worth noting that there has since been some slowdown in new SPAC formation and an uptick in regulatory caution. We expect such shifts to continue in these early days.<\/p>\n<p>For a SPAC, finding a company to merge with in 24 months might sound like a good amount of time, but in reality, the diligence and SEC process can easily consume six months or more. So identifying the target company relatively quickly becomes critical.

But it could be as simple as introducing a low-code integration platform.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"wUhIzEkByM\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/19\/time-strapped-it-teams-can-use-low-code-software-to-drive-quick-growth\/\">Time-strapped IT teams can use low-code software to drive quick growth<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Time-strapped IT teams can use low-code software to drive quick growth&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/19\/time-strapped-it-teams-can-use-low-code-software-to-drive-quick-growth\/embed\/#?secret=wUhIzEkByM\" data-secret=\"wUhIzEkByM\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h2>European VC soars in Q1<\/h2>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1996009\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1996009\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1996009\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-GRN.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-GRN.jpg 2880w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-GRN.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-GRN.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-GRN.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-GRN.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-GRN.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-GRN.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-GRN.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1996009\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nigelsussman.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nigel Sussman <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)<\/span><\/a><\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>A stunning first quarter in venture capital funding was not restricted to the United States; Europe also had one hell of a start to the year.<\/p>\n<p>The venture capital world kicked off its 2021 European investing cycle with enough activity to set the continent on the path that would crush yearly records.<\/p>\n<p>Inside the data, there\u2019s lots to unpack, including which sectors of European startups stood out in terms of capital raised, rising seed and late-stage deals, and dollar volume.
